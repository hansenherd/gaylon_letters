# gaylon_letters

This project is one I've wanted to do for some time. I received these letters
from Grandma Hansen years ago and have had them in storage.

I wanted to present these letters in a form where the originals could be read,
but have them transcribed as best as possible so that anyone reading didn't have 
to decipher handwriting.

I also wanted to be able to produce a PDF in it's final form so that the content
would be readily accessible to anyone interested. I also wanted to make sure that 
the PDF had a Table of Contents so that the PDF wasn't one big dump of letters, and
would be accessible via letter/chapter headings.

I played with several different document creation pieces of software, from
Word to Latex. I ended up using AsciiDoc which seems to have the simplest
document layout that does what I want...displaying a scanned letter side-by-side
with the transcribed text.

The choice of AsciiDoc may not be the easiest for others to ever edit or modify,
as it would take some learning the AsciiDoc format, however, I found that it
enabled me to quickly put together the images and text how I want to generate
the desired PDF.
