Dear Folks

I started a letter but left it with my book at the Bishops so I'll just drop a card for now. The members who lent us their records to record really seem to like pine nuts. We would like to give them some to show our appreciation if you still have a lot, if you don't then never mind. We have a big Conference this weekend. The Stake is being split. Two apostles will be here. 

Elder Nielson is master of ceromonites for a later conference.

Congratulate Jean & Forrest for me...everything is going great,

Love Gaylon
