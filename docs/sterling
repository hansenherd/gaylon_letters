Hi! Mom, Dad & Doug

Well today is Monday again. I guess this will be the shortest time I will be with one companion. He called Pres Maycock & he made an appointment for him to see a doctor in Champaine Ill. He called him again Thursday & found that he was being transferred there. He will leave Thursday.

We have really been getting along good. It was hard for me the first week but he is coming out of it a lot. He gave a couple of discussions this last couple days - that's something he hadn't done for months previous to this.

We both talked in Sacrament meeting yesterday. He surprised everyone by giving an excellent

talk. It made me feel rather ashamed of myself.

We had a wonderful turnout of investigators. We had 8 out for the first time plus all the ones we have baptized.

Sunday night we had a tremendous fireside at Bro. Nelsons. There were about 20 people there & we had the young boys that we baptized give short talks. Then I played my tape recording of the "Joseph Smith Story". Everyone really liked it. One of the members that is on the District High Council asked me if I could get a recording from mine.

We are going to get an M.I.A. going in about 2 weeks I guess. I think it will really

help us out a lot.

Well I better close. It doesn't seem like I can get organized today. It is noon & we haven't accomplished anything much.

Welder Bealey really hates to leave. We have met a lot of fine youth & he says he has talked more to people here than he ever thought of. I guess he had to being with me.

There is no such thing as a Senior companion here. we each take charge & have the final say every other week.

Sis Clancy's address is:
	520 California
	Waterloo, Iowa

Yes I got the tape but I couldn't play what you recorded. It sounded like it was playing backwards.

	Love Gaylon
