Hi Mom & Dad

Conference was just terrific. I talked to pres Maycock for the last time. We are dedicating thes month to him & Sis Maycock.

They have a big place of the corn up. If their cilos won't hold it they make a circle out of snow fence & put the rest of the corn in that. Everything's great.

Love Gaylon

I got to baptize Sis. Clancy Sunday after conference. It was really great. They took us to dinner.
