Mom & Dad

I got your letter today. Thanks for the money. I have bought some good shoe trees for my new shoes already.

It sounds like you are going to have some good meat for this winter. We usually buy hamburger. The last while we have gotten it for 29 cents a pound. Usually it's 49 cents/#.

I have really been busy trying to get X-mas cards sent out. I have them sent to the people I have met in other towns & it can wait a day or two here. It has been real cold the last while here. It is snowing today. We put a light under our car battery to keep it warm. We had to have a tune up before it would even begin to start.

We are going to give some of our golden contacts a copy of a Marvelous Work & wonder by LeGrand Richards for X-mas. Also, I bought a copy for the people I have baptized here in Sterling.

Well I've got to go so I'll mail this.

Thanks for all you have done for me Mom & Dad. I love you a great deal more than I can express in words.

	Love Always
	Your son
	Elder L.G. Hansen
