Hi Mom & Dad

This past week has really been terrific. Brother & Sister Slifer were interviewed today. They will be baptized Sunday. They have really been interested. They were to church for the 2nd time Sunday. When I gave them the 3rd discussion, they gave me 2 pipes 1/2 carton cigarettes & over a pound of coffee. They have accepted everything we have told them. They wanted to go to Chicago on the first to our all mission baptism but he has to work. We have a young man that has been interviewed & should go. We have had a lot of good meetings. Tonight we met with a family that we have been working off & on with for about 4 months. The wife heard about baptism for the dead & she wouldn't even listen. Finally through the husband we have got to listen to our discussions. They were really impressed & invited us back real soon.

Everything is going great.

Love Gaylon

Yes, Pres Nelson paid for that phone call.

I got a big box of cookies & candy plus a set of the tack from the Clancy's.

We are still having trouble with the car. I guess it needs new plugs.
