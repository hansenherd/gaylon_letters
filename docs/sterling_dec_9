Hi Mom & Dad

Elder Curtis & I are doing real well together. The first of last week we couldn't get anything accomplished but later on we had a log of meetings. Elder Curtis gave all he knew of the 1st discussions 6 times.

We decided to buy a copy of "A Marvelous Work And  A Wonder" for some of our contacts for X-Mas. We sent an order to the mission home for over $13 for supplies & some of those books.

I didn't know what to get you for X-Mas so I sent for a couple of books that I have heard are really tremendous. I had them mail them to you in Dad's name so don't open them until X-Mas when they come.

Mom could you order a subscription to Connie & Larraine &

their families for me? If they ever get a chance to read I know they would really enjoy that. I never really realized there was such a good magazine put out by the church until I came out here.

Last month they had a big color picture of all the temples & a big story about each.

One of the members has invited us out to X-mas dinner already. She has a girl in Cedar city going to school. Karen Padgett is her name. 

Marily wrote & said she had listened to my farewell tape so I guess it got there all right.

Our traveling Elder said there wouldn't be many transfers from now to X-Mas so I will be here until after the New Year sometime.

I got your check ok. I have plenty of money. I got the

card saying I'd get the Relief Society magazine.

It sounds like you are really working in the Relief Society mom. It sure makes me glad to hear you took charge. I know just what you mean when you say you were scared.

I got a card from Sis. Clancey today.

The Nelson's address is:
	1809 East 5th St
	Sterling, Ill

What should I get Doug for X-mas or what?

Got a meeting to attend.

Love
Gaylon
