== Prologue
Years ago, during a visit to Grandma & Grandpa Hansen's in Richfield, Grandma pulled me aside
and told me she had this box of letters that dad had written to her during his mission, and she wanted me to have
them. It turns out there were several letters written during his first year of college, prior to his mission. I've
had these letters for a long time and at one point had sorted them chronologically as best I could. As part of a
young women's project, I got Jessica to help me transcribe the letters and get them into a form that can be shared
with everyone.

NOTE: Where possible, I've included the dates when the letters were mailed, however, many letters are not in envelopes. I was able to group some letters based on notes Grandma Hansen made on the letters, but many letters were hard to put into any context.

Hi Mom & Dad

Well we got to Provo all right. We arrived here at about 12:30 & then we stopped at the "State Bank of Provo" and took out a checking account. We didn't get the regular account because if we didn't write very many checks it would cost us more than 10 cents a check for a minimum service charge.

When we were checking in I got a wrong key so I have had to get the head resident to open the room every time I go in.

Just after I got checked in, my room-mate came in. His name is Joe Lone & he is from California. He seems to

be a real nice kid. I think we'll get along all right. He is on scholarship to play football. The position he plays is quarter-back so he really isn't so big, about 185 pounds. His dad owns a chemical plant down in California & he's got a 59 Corvette. He took me for a ride downtown to pick up some things that he had forgotten.

Tuesday we got up at 6:30 & took our time getting to breakfast (as everyone did) & so there was a line for about a block waiting to eat. When we went to our first meeting in the Field house were late & it was half full of freshmen, about 4,000.

We got out of taking all those placement tests but they had other meetings for us to attend.

Tuesday night we started out to go to M.I.A. but we couldn't find the right wards until it was kind of late so we just looked in on two or three wards.

Today we had more meetings in the morning & in the afternoon we had 15 minutes with our advisor. He told me that if I didn't declare a major in engineering & just filled some general requirements that it would more than likely take me an extra year. I don't know what to do about that.

Dahl & Robert & myself are trying to figure out our registration & we’re all going out in engineering (at least trying to work something out in that field). They recommend 15-15 ½ hours credit & we will most likely have to take 16 ½ hrs. I still can’t decide whether to declare a major or not.

The meals they serve are real good & I quite like my room. It is the most modern rooms available. The only thing I don’t like is the public showers & washing basins.

I think I’ll really like it up here if I can get settled on some classes that I like. We’re going to eat now so I’ve got to get going.

Love  Gaylon

Monday Sept. 25/1961

Hi! Mom & Dad. I was going to write you last Saturday & for sure Sunday but somehow the time just flew & I didn’t get around to doing it.

How are you getting along with the haying operation? Did the rain spoil any of it? Or didn’t it rain much after I left. All last Thursday & Friday it rained a steady shower up here. We were sure glad to see the sun come up the other day. It’s been so cloudy & dripping wet for a couple of days that we were beginning to wonder if it would ever clear up. There was a lot of

snow Friday up on Mt. Timpanogos & the surrounding mountains. It has been right cold at nights & early morning.

Boy, this college life sure is expensive. The first time I went to my civil engineering class they gave us a list of all the tools & materials that we would need. Before I got through, it cost thirty dollars. I also had to buy a few notebooks & chemistry lab workbooks.

I went to my religion class Thursday (Robert Tobley & myself)  but the teacher didn’t come. There were only about seven in the class so we got checking our registration later that

afternoon. We found that when we registered in the religion section the advisors had changed the section number on our own cards but they forgot to connect the teacher & room assignments. I don’t know how this will work out but I guess the worst that can happen is that we’ll get behind an extra assignment.

Saturday my roommate (Joe) traded rooms with another guy across the hall. So now my roommate is Bob Wenlen. He’s from Ouray, Colorado. He is sort of quiet but he is real nice. He has a record player & a whole drawer

full of long-playing records. He seems to be real studious & he’s majoring in psychology.

Last Sunday we rode up Provo canyon and was going to take some pictures but it was a little cloudy. We stopped and looked at Bridal Veil falls for a while. They have got three cables going from the highway to the top of the mountain.

How’s the apartment coming along. Are you going to sell it then? Or what?

Dahl just came over for a while & he helped me solve some of my math problems. OH, & Stanley Nielson came in for a few minutes on his way back to S.L.C.

Boy these classes are going to be rough. We had to do a 500-word theme for last Monday in English. Today we had a spelling test & an assignment to read & have a test on Wednesday. Next Friday we have an in class theme. We’ve been hitting math hard everyday & now he’s talking about having a class one night a week to kind of review & explain anything that we don’t have time for in class.

Last Sunday Bob & Dahl bought us a bucket of apples (delicious; $3.00). They were $3.50 but they said we could have them for $3.00 because we

were students at the Y. At the rate we’ve been eating them they’ll be gone in a week. They sure taste good.

We went & seen a real good show the other night out at the pioneer Drive-in. The name of it was “Tamy tell me true” or something like that.

Dahl & Bob (Robert Tobley) said they might be coming down next weekend, but I don’t think I better. Bob, I think, kind of misses that girl of his (Mary Ann).

Well it’s getting kind of late so I better be getting to bed. Write soon.

Love you all

Hi mom & dad

I got your letter yesterday along with one from Laraine. I sure was glad to get them. We just got back from eating so I decided to write while I didn’t have many lessons. Bob & I studied about all day Saturday catching up on them. Then we went to the show “David & Golith”. It was really good. (I doubt that name is spelled right but maybe you can get the meaning).

Friday I went down to the health center & had my physical examination. It took me about an hour so I missed a chemistry class. I had to fill out a long question-air about everything from bad eyes to high blood pressure.

Today we got up & was all dressed up when we remembered that it was conference today. So we just laid around, read, and listened to Bob’s record player. He got a couple of new records in the mail yesterday & he had to break them in.

This afternoon I took him up Provo Canyon so he could take some pictures. He has a Brownie 8 mm. camera, a real nice one. We stayed at ”Bridal Veil falls” & both took pictures of that. There were a lot of people there looking at the falls & Cleggs building. There’s a sign that says that it will be opened on the 15th but I don’t see how they can do it. There is an awful lot of work to be

done, in fact I couldn’t see that they had one much since the last time I was up there.

Saturday I took Bob down to the selective service to sign up but they were closed. I guess I’ll have to take him down some time during the week. He put a dollars worth of gas in the can & it just about filled it. That is after we went up Provo Canyon & out to the lake for awhile. So you can see that I am not using the car very much. There is about three days a week that I don’t even start the motor.

Thanks for sending up the paper articles. I had already heard about Art Nielson going to the hospital after that football game. Robert Tobley had talked to Dean Lansen (the new basketball coach down there) I guess they came up to see the football game when we played San Jose State.

The B.Y.U. football team played North Texas State, or somebody from Texas, last night. When we were going to the show the score was 24-15 in our favor. But during the show they flashed the score on the screen. It was 41-33 in favor of Texas. The whole audience gave a big moan. That was the final score.

NOTE: The BYU vs North Texas State was played on Sept. 30, 1961 with BYU losing 30-41

Yesterday Bob & I washed some sox & a couple of pairs of pants. He ironed his pants so I did too. It wasn’t too bad but I got one seam (or crease) a little off to the one side. You know those green (light) pants that i wore a lot last summer. We was goofen around & I split them all down one side. Maybe you can sew them up when I bring them down but I don’t think I’ll be able to wear them to school any more.

Well I guess I had better close for now. I think we might make it to church

a|Hi mom & Dad,

Well it’s Monday so I’ll write. We had a study class this morning with 4 other missionaries this morning, then we all came to our apartment for dinner.

My companions name is Charles Clark & he is from Salt Lake. I am in Evanston, Illinos now. We cover 4-5 other towns around in this area we are just north of Chicago, in fact, the northern tip is in our area.

I got letters from Marilyn & her mom today. She is really busy I guess.

I really like it here. I haven’t noticed any change in the climate yet, I live just a few blocks from the lake. When we were in the mission home the lake was just a few feet from the back door. It looks just like the ocean to me.

Last Thursday, after we had stayed in the mission home one night, they had missionaries come in & go tracting with us. I was really  nervous (I still am as for as that goes)
|===
<<<

a|But we got in & gave part of a lesson in 4 homes. My companion said that was pretty good. I am having trouble learning the lessons. Also I’m having problems remembering the names of all the people I should.

Last night my companion & I showed the film “What is a Mormon” to 11 of the youth in the First Baptist Church & the Reverend. It was quite funny, they asked us to come for dinner & while it was being prepared the Reverend showed us all through their church. We answered questions for about 30 minutes after the film.

I spoke to a baptism Saturday afternoon. I only talked for about two minutes but it scared me anyway. There were eleven from all the areas baptized. Elder Clark said there would probably be 50-60 baptized in the whole N.S. mission.

NOTE: N.S. = Northern States

I’ve got to help a couple of missionaries move in into another ward so I’ll have to close soon.

a|I’m not even considered to be in the mission field. We have a million dollar Stake house in our area where two wards attend church. It’s supposed to be one of the best places in the mission though, even if it is expensive. If they spend only $110.00 they feel real good about it. I’ll let you know when I need some money.

Well I've got to close,

Love you very much

Hi Mom & Dad & Doug

We’re on the way to church so I’ll try & write a little.

We’re supposed to meet a contact there. He called up Thursday & said he was interested in our church. Also a man called the mission home & said he wanted to be baptized. I couldn’t believe it.

I gave the whole lesson (1st one) for the first time last night. I got going & my mind went blank. I left some of it out Elder Clark said I did pretty good though. I didn’t get near as nervous as I have done when we are just studying & practicing. I know I had a lot of help in controlling my nervousness.

1pm: After church we talked with a lady missionary from northern California. She is giving us some suggestions on how to get more cooperation from the stake missionaries. This mission is really growing in the last while, baptisms have doubled

We are going to speed up the progress & in a few months we’re going to be the top mission in the mid-American missions. They are having competition on a mission & region basis.

7 more were baptized in our region yesterday.

Elder Clark & I are meeting a lot of people and we hope to lead some of them into the water this month. I say lead but actually it seems like pushing. The missionaries put a lot more pressure on people than I even thought they should but now I can see the need for it.

We had a visit with a Mrs. Chamberlain & tried to get her to let us teach her or come to church but she wouldn’t. She is the only parent & has 4 kids. Some of the girls have been attending MIA & really like it so she decided rather than take a chance of them joining

she is taking her whole family to her church. She is really a wonderful woman but she is just afraid to change. She is very poor but she is very strong willed so it doesn't look like we have a chance to teach her. How would you approach someone like that? I certainly don't know.

Everything is really great here. The time is really flying. We have a cleaner that does our shirts for us free so that really makes it nice.

Well I’ve got to close so write soon

Your loving son

Dear Mr & Mrs. Hansen & Doug,

I guess it is about time I stop being so slothful and get a letter off to a family I love very much.

I just received the tape from Gaylon of his farewell. When I played it- it was like reliving it all over again. I think it was real good for me to hear it.

Gaylon sure has grown in the past 14 months hasn’t he? I am so glad that he loves the work so. The people seem to also have a love for the Elders.

How have all of you been? I bet it is getting real cold down there. Boy, it sure is here.

My work is coming along fine. We have a really fun

office and bunch of girls. It really is different than being around L.D.S. girls though.

There really isn’t much news around here. My family is fine. Mom and I both feel fine. My bottom still bothers me but in general I feel a lot better. I am sure thankful for that.

How is Doug doing in his school work. How are Connie & Laraine’s families?

I am going to close for now. I sure do miss being close to your family. I sure will be glad when these next ten months are over and Gaylon and I can be together again. My love for Gaylon has grown more and more since he has been gone.

The first thing I want to say is that I love all so much. Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness in sending me lovely and so much appreciated gifts. You are so clever. I wish I could thank you in another way than by words. You all have done so much for me and I surely appreciate it.

We had a very lovely Christmas. Our family has so much fun when we’re all together. Most of my gifts were for my hope chest.

I have found out that I need glasses. I wonder what else can happen. My other problem still isn’t cleared up. I have to see the Dr. Thursday, the bleeding still hasn’t stopped.

How was your Christmas? Were you all able to get together? Next year Gaylon will be home. That sure will be nice. I love the work he is doing, but I’ll sure be glad when he gets back.

We got here at Provo about 5:30 pm. Connie and I sure had a nice visit on the way down and back. I’m sure glad we can be as close as we are.

Dear Folks

I started a letter but left it with my book at the Bishops so I'll just drop a card for now. The members who lent us their records to record really seem to like pine nuts. We would like to give them some to show our appreciation if you still have a lot, if you don't then never mind. We have a big conference this weekend. The Stake is being split. Two apostles will be here.

Elder Nielson is master of ceremonies for a later conference.

Congratulate Jean & Forrest for me...everything is going great,

Hi Everyone

Its M-day again & we are waiting for Elder Nielsen & Christensen to get their teeth checked.

It's a lot warmer now. We haven't had any trouble getting our car started since we got it fixed. It sure takes a lot of gas in this cold weather. We have had to start Elder Nielsons car with jumper cables & when it is stubborn to start we use a lot of gas just racing the motor.

It seems like I spend a lot more money than I should. I am going to try & cut down on expenses this month. Last month (4-week period) I spent $135.00. Of course I bought $18.00 worth of tape that I would not ordinarily have spent. We used the tape & have finished recording the Book of Mormon Pearl of Great Price & The D.&C.

I'm glad we were able to get it on tape. It will be nice to have

We are going to have a big conference next Sunday - Tues. - Sunday LeGrand Richards & Howard Hunter are going to be here & divide Chicago Stake & make three stakes. They are going to talk to us in a special missionary conference. Then all day Monday & Tuesday we will be in a Region Conference.

We may go to a museum this afternoon.

How is the apartments coming along? I hope you can keep most of them rented.

I finally got my book & this letter from the Bishop. We helped his wife get their car home after she hit a tree. She couldn't stop on slick roads. I left my boots & this letter in the car.

We saw the Museum of Science & Industry, or at lest we spent the afternoon

trying to see parts of it. There is so much that is really fascinating that we couldn't begin to see it.

We took the records B of M D&C & P. of G.P. back to Sister Morgan. She said they cost a total of $100. We got them on tape for less than $15. I still have a couple of reels left over. We got it for $1.88 a reel of 2400 feet - it is pretty good tape for that price. I am now recording "The Son of God" a talk given by Pres. Edmunds entirely from the scriptures.

I guess I better close & review for our test on the study guide in conference.

Tell everyone hello for me.

NOTE: Note on back of the envelope

I got your letter today - no I haven't recieved that tape Marilyn was supposed to have sent. My recorder is all right. I cleaned the recording heads & it works a lot better. The Book of Mormon is advertisted in the Improvement Era for 50 dollars. If I find I can't use it very much I could send the tapes to Connie & Vernon. Tell Laraine I was glad to hear from her. It sounds like Greg is doing real well.

Hi Mom & Dad

Well it’s the 11th of March & cold as ever. It was clear all day yesterday but it still didn’t melt at all. There must be an arctic mass of cold air over us.

I am using my tape recorder quite a bit. Last week we got a recording by the British Broadcasting Company entitled “This Is The Place”. It tells the story of the church from Joseph Smith on. It is really funny with the English accent of the speakers. We are going to use it at a fireside this weekend.

I have been thinking about calling you the past few days

Elder Rothey called home Thursday & talked for 20 minutes. It cost him about $11 to. His folks are moving from Ogden to Richmond, Virginia.

We went to a party for the Relief Society Saturday night. The women & their husbands were there & we played some silly games & then had a big dinner.

The work is really going slow. I guess I should say we are really going slow. We don’t have any investigators at all. We went to a family yesterday & they stood us up for the 4th time in a row.

The traveling Elders stopped for about 25 minutes last

Tuesday. They are thinking about closing down the city & moving us to another.

I sure am discouraged. It’s not because of the work so much as it is just me. Sometimes I think I am losing my memory. When I study or try to remember names or places I can’t get anything to register. They say you can train your brain just like you can develop a muscle & I can sure see that mine is not trained.

We spend a lot of time just trying to think of somewhere

to go & something to do. I get so lazy sometimes that I get to the point that I almost don’t even care.

I guess I shouldn’t be writing you like this. I am just a little depressed at the things I am doing.

At least here, there is enough time for me to study that I can keep up in my study guide. That is more than I could do in Evanston.

Mom you are sending the money plenty early. If it gets here by the first of the month or a few days before that is early enough. Just know I can get it cashed & have it to pay rent on the first. I was wondering if you were getting ahead of me for a month. This last check you sent me should last until the end of April.

It is good to have a little money ahead but the past couple of months I have been packing the checks with me until about the last day of the month & I don’t think

Hi Mom and Dad

Yesterday we had a tremendous District Conference in Cedar Rapids. President Maycock and his counselors all spoke along with the district officers. Pres. Maycock really called everyone to repentance. I think everyone left with somewhat of a guilty conscience. He especially called down the members for quarreling and back-biting. Then last night we had a testimony meeting for two hours.

Today we are going to meet at the chapel and then go play softball and volleyball for a few hours and then we will resume the conference. We are staying at one of the members homes near Cedar Rapids. When we came in last night they had a big stack of ham sandwiches and some apple pie for us to snack on. They are really treating us great.

Last Saturday I was able to baptize a man

at a Y.W.C.A. swimming pool. He was married to a Mormon and his family had been convert about 5 years ago. We have been working with him for about two weeks.

We have been teaching a family that are really big people in Waterloo and they were going to come to conference yesterday but his father got extremely sick and on the verge of death so they couldn’t come. Something like this has happened for the past three weeks to prevent them from coming to church. The old devil really works on the people out here to keep them from joining the church.

I was really glad to hear that Marilyn came and stayed with you before she left. She said she had such a wonderful time and that you treated her so well. It makes me feel good to know that you get along so well.

Well it’s Tues. now and we are doing our washing. I got my jacket and that other material you sent - thanks a lot. Thanks for the missionary diary. It is really a nice one. It got the back bent in shipping though and that made me feel quite bad.

The conference was really a call to repentance for everyone yesterday.

Well, I’ve got to close off. Find out what speeds Connie has on her tape recorder. Tell her I am sorry I haven’t written and I’ll try to write her soon. If she has 1 ⅞ speed, I could send her The Book of Mormon. She said she wanted it.

Thank you for everything Mom and Dad.

Hi Mom and Dad

Well today is Monday and we are moving to Waterloo today. We have an apartment there for $50 plus utilities and then we will have a little more room and be closer to the work. I am through packing and am waiting for my companion. Our new address will be: 920 ½ Broadway, Waterloo, Iowa. We are right on a main highway there so it will be real convenient that way, but we are also right next to the railroad tracks and trains pass quite frequently.

My companion bought him a $200 stereo tape recorder the other day. It made mine look sick. It is really a fancy one. Mine is giving me a lot of service. Nothing has went wrong with it really. I’ve had to clean it a couple of times and do a little tinkering with it but it works real well. If you can remember ask Connie how long the warranty is for it. I was just wondering because my companion had to take a new recorder back because it didn’t work properly - that’s when he got his big recorder. Also how long was the warranty on my clock good for? I just got it back for the second time and it still doesn’t work like I think it should. I wish I had just threw it away and got another. There has been so much delay and trouble getting it through the mail and them not fixing it and all. Maybe if I

would have sent it in earlier I would have gotten better results though so I guess it’s my own fault.

I am in Waterloo now. I just got through calling the water company and the electrical power company to get that taken care of. It sure is a big nuisance to get all this taken care of. We are having a lot of complications as to whose name it is going to be in. We finally got it in their name so it will save us a $8 deposit.

We have to buy a phone and have it put in so I guess that will cost us another $10.

It has been raining a lot the past couple of days - we really got a good soaking yesterday. How is the water situation back there? I guess it is still bad - isn’t it?

There is a real good family living in the house below us. We have an appointment to show them the film and they seem real interested. We also are working with our landlord who is part owner in a rambler agency here. The work is starting to pick up and I feel real good about it.

I hope everything is going file. Have them send the Era to my new address or the mission home. I am really glad they are sending it. That is the one magazine we read.

Write soon

My companion is Dean Jorgensen from Brigham City. We are getting along real well.

with him. He said they had some problems to talk over. So I got a good nights rest while he travelled 20 miles. Also they got picked up for only having one light and to top it off they had a flat tire. I think I got the best of that deal.

I really like it here in Waterloo. It is a nice town but the street setup is really a mess.

We are having a contest in the mission to get the most hours and meetings. I can’t get enthused over it but we are doing ok I guess. The other Elders had 2 baptisms yesterday.

They called it in at Waverly and I was in Waterloo so I didn’t get a chance to call up and find out what it was until 10:30. The Elders said it was from and it had me kinda worried. I couldn’t figure out what the folks would send me a telegram for. She wished me a happy Easter -- quite the girl.

Hi Mom & Dad,

I guess I won’t get time to write a letter so I’ll send this.

We had two softball games in Davenport Iowa last week. Our girls beat 19-11 & our boys got beat 9-15. We have a lot of kids playing on our teams. We have a lot of fun taking them to play ball. A couple of them should be baptized before long.

We are taking everyone to a Hawaiian barbecue this Sat. It should be good fellowship for them. Sister Brill -- the lady we baptized, is a completely different person almost. I can’t believe how much she has changed. It’s amazing what the gospel can do for these people when they accept it. Things are going great.

We picked up the Elders in Rock Island & we had to wait a while for them. We are on a big super-highway with a 75 M.P.H. speed limit.

is drying up & turning brown too. They plant all over the rolling hills & you can see corn for miles & miles. Everyplace there is a drainage area or where two hills form a small valley the corn hasn’t grown because of too much water.

This month the mission is dedicating to Pres. McKay since he will be 90. I guess it is his birthday today isn’t it? The work is going real well. We have three families that could be baptized this month if we can help them overcome their

problems. The lady whose husband died (Sis. Legal) said she would start coming to church. She doesn’t want to join because it would be hard for her to be baptized & also she doesn’t think she can pay tithing. They are really having a hard time. The one 11 year old boy can’t sleep at home because he things about seeing his father laying on the floor. He was the first one to find out his father was dead.

We finally made it but we can’t find the school. Everything is going ok.

their families for me? If they ever get a chance to read I know they would really enjoy that. I never really realized there was such a good magazine put out by the church until I came out here.

We have really been getting along good. It was hard for me the first week but he is coming out of it a lot. He gave a couple of discussions this last couple days - that's something he hadn't done for months previous to this.

This past week has really been terrific. Brother & Sister Slifer were interviewed today. They will be baptized Sunday. They have really been interested. They were to church for the 2nd time Sunday. When I gave them the 3rd discussion, they gave me 2 pipes 1/2 carton cigarettes & over a pound of coffee. They have accepted everything we have told them. They wanted to go to Chicago on the first to our all mission baptism but he has to work. We have a young man that has been interviewed & should go. We have had a lot of good meetings. Tonight we met with a family that we have been working off & on with for about 4 months. The wife heard about baptism for the dead & she wouldn't even listen. Finally through the husband we have got to listen to our discussions. They were really impressed & invited us back real soon.

We baptized a young lady 16 years old Saturday evening in Rock Island. We were very happy about that.

Sister Brill, one of the ladies we baptized is going to a Relief Society conference in Chicago this weekend. I was really glad to hear that.

Thanks for sending the tape. I have only listened to part of it as of now but I really enjoy hearing it. It really brings back memories.

I just ask my landlady about how to clean my blanket and she said she would wash it for me so she is. She has an old

Washer with tubs and a ringer like you used to have. They are sure good to us.

I got two cavities filled this morning by President Nelson. He is really a good dentist. I wouldn’t let him freeze my mouth and he said most people wouldn’t let him drill without it. I would a lot rather have him drill and have it hurt a little than have your face numb all day.

My watch is in the repair shop. It will cost about $10.00 to have it cleaned and fixed. I guess the main thing wrong is that it needs cleaning.

I took my suit in this morning. They are going to send it back to the company and see what they will do.

It will take at least two weeks before I get it back. I hope they will give me something on it.
I haven’t listened to all of the recording - I’ll have to, so I can hear what you said.

I better close for now.

Dear Folks

It was really good to talk to you the other night. It seemed like I was just up the street talking to you. Dad’s voice didn’t quite sound like him. I guess I haven’t talked to him on the phone enough to recognize his voice.

I’m sure glad to hear the crops are doing so well. If you can keep the beets doing ok they should do all right for you with the jump in the price of sugar and all.

The work is really picking up here in Sterling. We had 6 young people to church for the first time. Two of them

are with us again today. This is the first time these boys have been with us on Mondays. We have an appointment with them and their mother tomorrow to show them the film strip and tell them about the church. I think they will be baptized this month. Yesterday in church one of the members brought his girlfriend up to us and said she wanted to be baptized. It really shocked us. We are going to meet with her tomorrow also.

Well I better close - slept in this morning and have a lot to catch up on. I got the money.

Dear Mom and Dad

Everything is really going great here in Sterling. Sunday we had 3 wonderful baptisms two of which were members of the softball team we have. We have a girls softball team now. We had our second practice today and when we told them they had to come to church to play, they got all mad and were going to quit. After we talked to them I said they could come to church so they could play.  The other baptism was a members girlfriend. We told him about three weeks ago to talk to her about becoming a member. He has

talked it over with her a lot since then and we gave her the lessons last week.

Today I went to the doctor to get some medicine for my arms. I have a rash or infection on them. Nothing serious at all. I put the prescription on it and now I can see it is starting to clear up.

Also today I bought a new pair of shoes. They had a big sale on, so I bought a real nice pair.

It’s now 11:45 and we are still doing our washing. I’ll close for now - Everything is going great.

a|Hi Mom & Dad

Last Thursday Elder Healey was transferred to Champaign Illinois so now I have a new companion. His name is Elder Christenson and he is one of the Elders I came out with. We are getting along real well. He was supposed to get here Thursday but he didn’t make it until Friday about 2:30pm. I took Elder Healey to the train at 6am Thursday so I was alone for quite a while. It really seemed funny. I had a lot of things I wanted to do though so the time went fast. I still didn’t get time to write to Karl & Dahl. I did send a tape to Connie & Vernon.

Mom that was sure sweet of you to send that note to my landlady. She didn’t or hasn’t said anything yet but I’m sure it made her feel good. I just handed it to her as we were going to a meeting.

a|Well we finally have an M.I.A. here. They announced Sunday that this Tuesday would be our opening social. We are really looking forward to it.

Friday we were walking out of a family home & met the paperboy and started talking to him. He was interested in the youth program so we made an appointment to meet his parents that evening. We went and talked to them and they are really interested. They stayed and talked to us until they were late for another appointment.

It looks like we are really going to have a lot of success this month. We have at least 8 that should be baptized if all goes well. We have given these over half of the discussions. One family we met a week ago and they have come to church twice, primary and a Sunday School party at one of the parks. Besides we have taught them 3 discussions, they are really coming along.

I’m going to check and see if my suit is back today. I hope they will help pay for it.

My companion now has a watch so it isn’t quite so bad being without mine.

It sounds like Dad is really busy, with the hay down and the beet dump opening soon.

a|Hi Mom & Dad

It looks like I will soon be transferred. This weekend we are having an “all mission” conference in Carthage Illinois. All the Elders in the mission will be there. This will probably be the only one I’ll get to attend while I’m on my mission because they only have them every 2-3 years.

Since everyone will be there it will be real easy to make transfers. I am thinking I’ll get a letter any day now telling me to bring all my things to the conference but I sure hope not. We have a lot of good people we are teaching & we just met another real good family last night.

We baptized the Legal family last Saturday in Davenport.

Sister Legal weighs about 330 pounds & I thought I might have a tough time but it went real well. We had to have the Relief Society President make a special dress out of some sheets. Her kids Barbara(9) & Gerry(11) were baptized also.

We also baptized a 11 year old girl (Bonnie Cobb). We have had trouble getting to even talk to her mother so we fasted & towards the end of the fast the District Supervisor & I went over & we got to talk to her. She was interviewed the same night & baptized the following evening.

We were really happy that she was baptized. I got to baptize all of them & Elder Christensen confirmed.

I got a letter from the Bishopric & they said the beet crop was good this year. I hate to hear dad’s isn’t going too well. He must really be working hard.

I could use some socks for X-mas. I like those I got to come out in or just make sure they are extra long & black. I almost need size 13 if they aren’t stretchy. I could use a couple of ties too. Other than that I am pretty well fixed. I could use a good pen though. Those Laraine gave me finally ran out. I liked them too.

I sounds like Vernon & Connie are really working hard

a|Hi Mom & Dad

Well we finally got moved into our apartment last week. It isn’t too bad except that only a couple of the electrical outlets & lights work. We have a couple of extension cords cluttering up the rooms so that we can have lights & electricity.

I was really glad to hear that you are going to church Dad. I hope that you will continue to go as often as you can. I hate to hear that you are not feeling very good this spring. It sounds like you are really going to have a hard time this summer if you can’t get feeling better & the way the water situation looks. We have had a lot of rain here the past week. I haven't heard the number of inches but it rained about 4 nights out of the week. I guess we have had about 3 inches or so.

I got that check you sent cashed all right. The Elders have went to one bank for a long time & we don't even have to have any identification.

I won't need any more money until the first of the month - I shouldn't at least. I'm starting to keep track of all I spend. It really surprised me that I had to write you for that much money after my check.

Mom there is a few things I would like to have you send me if you can. I would like to have the sports jacket I bought for $30. I have the extra pants for it. My suit I got at Pullman tailors is really going downhill fast. I will be kinda glad when it is gone. It won't hold a crease & the pleats fall. I really like my new suit. After I was out here about 1 month the one pair of pants had two holes in it where I had ripped them in the car. I had them patched & it is looking pretty good.

Also I think I have a new clip board that I bought just before I came out. If it is hard to pack you don't need to send it though.

I had a little red booklet on English that I used in high school & if you can find it I would like to have it. We called it a "English Bible" but I don't know if that is the right title.

In my English journal there are some poems I would like to have. "If" by Rudyard Kipling is one, then one on Abraham Lincoln & it starts out "It is portentous and a thing of State that here at midnight a mourning figure walks" Then there is one called "A Friend by the side of the road" or something - I never memorized it but I would like to have a copy of it.

I was thinking about asking you to send me that "Dictionary of Thought" but I not to. In fact check & see if it is there. I loaned it to Dahl & I'm not sure if he ever gave it back. He was going to but I don't remember of getting it. There is no hurry on any of these things but I would like to have at least the sports jacket. The others it really doesn't matter too much.

Well I guess I better close for now. Everything is going fine - I like it a lot better here, we keep quite busy & we have a couple of families that are interested. I gave the first discussion to some college students yesterday.

I hope you can get to feeling better Dad. I'm sure it will work out with the farming but I hate to hear you are not feeling good. I want to thank you & mom for all you've done for me. I love you both very much & I hope I can develop myself to the kind of a person you will be proud to say is your son.

Love Always

a|
*IF*  by Rudyard Kipling

     If you can keep your head when all about you
         Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
     If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
         But make allowance for their doubting too;
     If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
         Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
     Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
         And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
     If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
         If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
     If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
         And treat those two impostors just the same;
     If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
         Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
     Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
         And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
     If you can make one heap of all your winnings
         And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
     And lose, and start again at your beginnings
         And never breathe a word about your loss;
     If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
         To serve your turn long after they are gone,
     And so hold on when there is nothing in you
         Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
     If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
         Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
     If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
         If all men count with you, but none too much;
     If you can fill the unforgiving minute
         With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
     Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
         And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

=== poem : Abraham Lincoln Walks At Midnight
*Abraham Lincoln Walks At Midnight* by Vachel Lindsay

    It is portentous, and a thing of state
    That here at midnight, in our little town
    A mourning figure walks, and will not rest,
    Near the old court-house pacing up and down.

    Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards
    He lingers where his children used to play,
    Or through the market, on the well-worn stones
    He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away.

    A bronzed, lank man! His suit of ancient black,
    A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl
    Make him the quaint great figure that men love,
    The prairie-lawyer, master of us all.

    He cannot sleep upon his hillside now.
    He is among us: -- as in times before!
    And we who toss and lie awake for long
    Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door.

    His head is bowed. He thinks on men and kings.
    Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep?
    Too many peasants fight, they know not why,
    Too many homesteads in black terror weep.

    The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart.
    He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main.
    He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now
    The bitterness, the folly and the pain.

    He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn
    Shall come; -- the shining hope of Europe free;
    The league of sober folk, the Workers' Earth,
    Bringing long peace to Cornwall, Alp and Sea.

    It breaks his heart that kings must murder still,
    That all his hours of travail here for men
    Seem yet in vain. And who will bring white peace
    That he may sleep upon his hill again?

=== poem : The House by the Side of a Road
*The House by the Side of a Road* by Sam Walter Foss

    “He was a friend to man, and lived In a house by the side of the road.” —Homer
    There are hermit souls that live withdrawn
    In the place of their self-content;
    There are souls like stars, that dwell apart,
    In a fellowless firmament;
    There are pioneer souls that blaze the paths
    Where highways never ran—
    But let me live by the side of the road
    And be a friend to man.

    Let me live in a house by the side of the road
    Where the race of men go by—
    The men who are good and the men who are bad,
    As good and as bad as I.
    I would not sit in the scorner’s seat
    Nor hurl the cynic’s ban—
    Let me live in a house by the side of the road
    And be a friend to man.

    I see from my house by the side of the road
    By the side of the highway of life,
    The men who press with the ardor of hope,
    The men who are faint with the strife,
    But I turn not away from their smiles and tears,
    Both parts of an infinite plan—
    Let me live in a house by the side of the road
    And be a friend to man.

    I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead,
    And mountains of wearisome height;
    That the road passes on through the long afternoon
    And stretches away to the night.
    And still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice
    And weep with the strangers that moan,
    Nor live in my house by the side of the road
    Like a man who dwells alone.

    Let me live in my house by the side of the road,
    Where the race of men go by—
    They are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong,
    Wise, foolish—so am I.
    Then why should I sit in the scorner’s seat,
    Or hurl the cynic’s ban?
    Let me live in my house by the side of the road
    And be a friend to man.

Dear Mom & Dad

Today we are going to Chicago. My companion is going to get his teeth fixed & I am taking my recorder along to see if I can get it fixed. It needs a rubber wheel on the inside. I sure hate the long ride in & back. Then we have all our washing to do once we get back too.

It’s been a lot colder the past week. We got about 4 inches of snow Friday & it’s gone now.

Sister Loose has a pack of Cub Scouts & they made some Indian rattles. What they did was paste paper around old light bulbs, then when that dried they would hit something to break the bulb & there would be the rattle.

It was the first time I had ever seen anything like that done. Everyone is making chocolate Easter eggs to sell & raise funds for the building.

Saturday we took some kids to a big hill & went tobogganing. It was a lot of fun but they sure don’t have very big hills out here. One of the boys is going to be baptized Friday if all goes well.  His mom has been holding him back somewhat so I don’t know for sure.

I heard last night that Colorado & Utah got 10 inches of snow. I sure hope that it got down south so it can do you some good.

We are washing again so I’ll write you now.

It has been really nice the past week. It has been quite warm & then Saturday it rained all day. It really melted the snow. It is all gone except where it has drifted & been shoveled back. There are big ponds all over. Some of the houses are almost completely surrounded with water. It is a lot colder today though.

I got a letter from Connie the same day I got yours. It was good to hear from them. It sounds like they are really about to go into the apartment

business like you are. Has the apartment been full all winter? I hope you can keep most of them rented. It sounds like Vernon is really helping you a lot.

We are going to have a region conference next week. It will seem funny going to a conference where I won’t know hardly anyone. I guess I got spoiled down in Evanston. Working with the District Supervisor everyone came at the baptismal services & I met them there. Here I never see another Elder except when the D.S. comes to work with us.

I never did find that $15. I guess I just lost track of it or something. It seems like the money goes so fast. I thought I could get by & save some this month but I have spent $80 & there is still two weeks to go. I’ve really watched my expenses this month too.

I was glad to hear you went to church Dad. I hope you will keep going when you can.

Hi Mom & Dad

How is everything going for you? I am rather discouraged at things out here. We went to one of our contacts for a meeting yesterday & they were not home for the second time in a row. Also two other families we were teaching told us not to come back. We don’t have even one good family that we are teaching now.

The weather has been real nice the past couple of days. It has gotten up to 30&#176; & has melted the snow off the roads. Then it is snowing again this morning. We thought spring was about here but I guess it isn’t. One of the members said that last summer there were only about 10 days that the temp even got above 80&#176;. I hope I get to stay up here this summer when it’s real hot. I’ll probably be

down south where it is hot.

I got a letter & a tape from Marilyn yesterday. That’s the first I had heard from her for almost two weeks. She said you had gone to her apartment & visited with her & met some of the fellows I went to school with last year.

Did Connie say anything about getting a tape from me? I sent one to them two weeks ago & I haven’t heard from them. I hope they got it.

The other night we went to a members home & he showed us a lot of slides he had taken while he was in the navy. It really sold me on having slides instead of just pictures. I have thought about getting a “slide” camera for a long time but I haven’t made any decisions yet. It costs so much money to get a good one. There are a lot of Elders that have them though. Write & let me know what you think about getting one.

I would like to have my “Line of Authority” if you could get it for me. Sometime when you’re not too busy maybe you could call Pres. Condie or maybe even his wife could get it for you. A lot of high officials like him have it printed on cards so that it will be handy when anyone asks for it. Also I was wondering if you have any very small bottles that I could use to keep oil in. I haven’t been able to find any yet. It should be real small & have a cap that would not leak.

The other night a man called us at 12 pm & asked us to come & administer to his wife. We did & the next morning when we visited her she said after we left she could feel relaxation come over her. She looked quite a bit better but she has so many troubles playing on her nerves that

I guess Marilyn is really working hard. She said she had to drop one of her classes. She seems to really enjoy having you stop & see her.

PS
I got your letter. I talked to Bro Sieber about his daughter. She is still there but having a rough time with finances.

I don’t think I’ll need any money till about the 1st. In my record keeping I lost track of $15 & I don’t know where it went. Maybe it just fell out of my wallet. I had it in the morning & come night it was gone. I still have enough for the month though unless something happens.

a|Hi Mom, Dad, Doug

It’s Monday again & we’re washing. The time sure is flying by.

This has really been a neat week. Wednesday we were tracting & the police came & took us down to the station & asked a lot of questions. Then Thursday night we just came home & a kid that lives in the apartment above us brought us an 18” pizza because they had ordered more than they could eat.

Friday we were in a motivation meeting & really put the pressure on. The word got around the ward & we have had to do some good explaining. It’s all worked out though, then Sunday night we talked with Pres Kennedy. He is President of the Chicago Stake, the Pres of the 1st Continental Bank (biggest in Chicago), he is also a big man in 3-4 corporations plus he is the head of the Tel-Star corporation.

We’ve sure been busy but we can’t seem to baptize anyone. The weather is really warm. I dyed my coat & I think I can use it all winter.

I’ve about got the lessons learned now. I have to go back & review until I can get the first ones in my mind again. I sure have a time remembering my scriptures.

Write soon

I remember that in the letter I got from the Bishopric that they are having some special classes for the older couples to attend. I was wondering if you & dad had decided to go & see what it is like. I can’t remember what the subject was but when I read it I can remember thinking that it would be good for you to go.

a|Hi Mom, Dad, & Doug

Dad, I was really glad to hear you went to church. I hope you will continue to go. I know how you feel about a lot of things like the welfare program & some of the ways things are done by some of the people that go there, but that is no reason for you to stay away just because a lot of other people don’t practice what they preach. I really didn’t realize what a perfect organization the church is till I got to studying it. I realize that are not carried out as they should but that is because of the faults of man. The organization itself is perfect, at least divinely guided. There is always room for improvement in various parts of the church. I do hope you will go to church regularly. I know it will be hard for you to not think about what other people do on week days & that is one thing I really honor you & mom for. You always do just what you say &...actually you are a lot better mormon than a lot who do go regularly but you still need to attend church. In conference one of the speakers stated a quote that really made me proud of you. He quoted Joseph Smith something like this “It is better to swear a streak as long as your arm than to be a smooth-faced hypocrite”

a|Hi Mom & Dad

Well I’ve been here a week now. I like it a lot. We have been working with the youth almost everyday. Playing softball with them & last Saturday we took one boy swimming at the YMCA. We had 7 investigators out to church Sunday. One parent & the rest young boys & 1 girl. The Elders baptized a lady & her son the Sunday before I got here. It looks like we should baptize some investigators this month too.

We are going to our Branch Presidents to get our teeth checked today. He is a dentist & was put in as Branch President just a few weeks ago.

Yesterday we went for a walk with a boy they just baptized to find some cardboard boxes. We went through a big hay field & over a creek & then through a corn field. If it hadn’t been in my suit it would have been just like being home. They have a lot of hay cut & the corn is up about 8-10 inches tall. It is good to hear all the crops are doing so well there.

Thank you for the wonderful Easter card. The cake & candy you sent was really good. My companion thought so too.

Everything is going find here. I hope you are all well & everything is going ok. Since I got here I have given the first couple of lessons three times. It sure seems good to be teaching the people.

My new companion had just bought a $80 tape recorder & when he saw what I could do he took it back & ordered a $200 one. His will be stereo & a lot bigger than mine.

We had quite a shake-up in the branch yesterday. Saturday night we had a potluck dinner & after that the former Branch President was put upon the stage as part of a “This is Your Life” program.

We had a real good program for  commemoration of the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood. My companion was the narrator of the program & then there was a lot of singing & background music. It was real impressive.

Dear Mom & Dad

Today is Monday & we are washing again. It seems like we do this almost every other day. The time is going so fast.

Yesterday I wrote a short letter to Sister Clancy again. That was the first one since right after I left. I have really heard a lot about them from the traveling Elders & also in the “Northern States News” Elder Jorgensen told about them. She said they are coming out west at X-mas & they might get to stop & see you.

Yesterday was really a disappointing day for me.

Saturday we talked to all our investigators & saw who was going to come to church. There were eight different families (at least part of the family) that said they would be there for sure. We called them up in the morning Sunday & all but one of them said they couldn’t come for various reasons. We went out to pick up one family & they had changed their mind. So instead of about 24 investigators we had one 7 year old girl that could come. We didn’t have the transportation problem anyway.

Saturday we took our girls softball team over to Clinton

Marilyn send me a big box of cookies & fruit cake the other day. It sure is good.

She said that her mother had to be operated on for something. I don’t believe she said what. She has to be operated for the trouble she has been having too. It sounds like they are really having hard luck with their health. She said she would probably be out of work for a month.

He is working as a dishwasher starting today - he has been working at a big supermarket. We have been going there to buy all our winter clothes.

She & her husband are going to come & visit us at our apartment on Christmas Eve. We’ll really have to clean up before they come.

We are going to one of the members homes at 5 AM in the morning to watch the children open their presents. We also might go to a midnight mass at one of the Catholic churches tonight.

We just got through playing basketball so I have a few minutes.

I really had a nice Christmas. We went to a Catholic Mass X-Mas Eve & that was really interesting. Then we got up at 5AM & went to a members home & watched their children open their presents. We ate breakfast & stayed there till noon & then we all went to another members home for dinner. Then they had a program with all their children & we even sang a song. It was really a nice Christmas. I didn’t even get homesick then but I have a little since. We don’t have many meetings to keep us busy & our minds on the work. But it hasn’t been bad. We are booked up for most of next week so that will keep us busy.

I still haven’t gotten the tape recorder. I guess I’ll get it soon though. I hope Vernon could get that one for $119. It sounded like a real good deal to me. Write & let me know how much money you have him for it & the shipping costs.

I’m finally over my sore throat & so is Elder Clark. The weather has been real nice

I’m sorry I didn’t write last week but school was out so we spent the day talking to kids & trying to get them out to our activities & get appointments with their parents. It worked out pretty well. We had about 10 investigators out to M.I.A. Tuesday, over half the youth there.

Last week was quite a disappointment. We had a family with 7 children that we had taught half the discussions & they had come to all our meetings for 2 weeks. The parents told us not to come back.

In one of your letters you mentioned that the missionaries were meeting with Joe & Bea. Did they say whether or not she was ever baptized?

My expenses were down last month only because I had paid my rent & reported it on the previous month. I should go on a diet though. I have gained a lot of weight. My one suit will hardly fit. I got a new $65 suit for $31. They allowed me $30 for the other suit. It looks like I will need more money but I’ll let you know later how much. I lost track of $15 last month again. I sure haven’t been keeping accurate records.

I better close for now. Has dad been going to church lately? I bet it’s pretty hard with all his work. I love you Mom & Dad. I sure wish I had listened more Dad.

Hi Mom & Dad

This last week has really been a mess. We really didn’t get anything accomplished. We were going to baptize three young people yesterday but last Thursday their father committed suicide. He shot himself with a shotgun. We went over as soon as we found out about it & took the kids to some of their friends so they would have a place to stay. We spent a lot of time talking to them for a couple of days. They had the funeral Saturday morning.

I am quite disappointed in my new suit. It is coming unsewed at the cuffs & other places all ready. Also the color is fading on the knees & cuffs. Elder Beal's suit just like mine is holding up real well. I guess I am just hard on suits. I finally threw away the pair of shoes I came out with. The ones I bought new to come out with are still in almost perfect shape.

6:30 Today we really cleaned the apartment. We scrubbed floors with a brush & everything. Our landlady was talking to us & a boy that was helping us picked up

Elder Beals & I are really in a mess with our expenses. We haven’t been keeping too good of records. He has been short for the last three months due to phone calls & other expenses & he doesn’t write for more hoping he can balance it

Hi Mom & Dad

Well it’s Monday again & we have a couple of boys with us. One of them is having his birthday today & another he’s is tomorrow so we decided to have them come with us & then later on today we’ll bake them a cake & have a little party. Last week we took them & camped out overnight. Elder Beals found a big grapevine & tied it on a big limb so everyone could swing on it. We all had a lot of fun. It was just like Stan & I used to out in our tree. A couple of days later some boys were down in the same place

They are on the final step of touring the world. They had pictures from China, Jerusalem, India, Hawaii & all over. They are going to London tonight & then over to Russia. They want Elder Beals to tour the world right after he gets off his mission

Sister Murray has almost completed the Book of Mormon in two weeks. She is really studying the church. After she was confirmed she said she would wash & iron the dress & then she said she might make a couple of different size dresses for us.

Saturday night we had a meeting with a family & we told them about the Word of Wisdom. They each smoke about a pack a day & drink a little & we were finishing up & when we told them that they spent at least $50 a month for things like that it really shocked them.

We have been able to meet with quite a few people this week. It doesn’t seem like we can teach them all the discussions though. After the first couple of discussions something always seems to happen so we can’t teach them any more.

We have a young man about 19 that should be baptized soon.

One of our families we are teaching had their son run away a couple of days ago. They haven’t heard from him since. We sure find some complicated affairs at times.

Our conference was in Rock Island.

They raise mostly corn & soy beans here-

Today we are in Rock Island having a district study class. We plan on going through the International Harvester company a little later on today. We were going to swim at the YMCA but they charge more than we wanted to pay so I guess we won’t.

We baptized Sister Brill yesterday. She is the mother of the first boy we baptized here in Sterling. The members are really giving us that support at our baptismal services. About half of them were to it yesterday & some of them took investigators home for us.

We had about 8 investigators to church most of them youth. We have really met some golden contacts the past week. Yesterday afternoon we talked to a girl & her brother about playing on our softball teams & participating in the youth program. We asked them what church they belonged to & they said Methodist. When we asked them how long they had been going there they said “today was our first day”. They quit their other church because they didn’t allow them to see movies or dance. We didn’t get to meet their parents but it looks like they should be baptized in the next couple of weeks.

We are trying to get an M.I.A. going so we will have something every week to bring the youth to. It doesn’t seem possible but it won’t be long till school starts.

Well I better close for now. The Elders are ready to go.

Yesterday we had 4 families that were going to attend church with us but by the time church started only one of them made it. We have both Sunday School & Sacrament meeting in the morning because the members come from such a large area.

After Sacrament meeting we baptized a 13 year old boy. We were able to get his mother to come & watch for the first time & she said she would come to church next Sunday. She will most likely be baptized next month if we can get her to coming to church.

a|Hi Mom & Dad

I have just arrived in Ottawa Illinois. I had Elder Curtis drive me here because it is only 70 miles from Sterling.

I am at President Armstrong’s home waiting for my new companion, Elder Barnnery.

Yesterday was really a wonderful day in my mission. I baptized Bro. & Sis. Slifer & their daughter, also Charles Shaw. We had the service right after testimony meeting in the Y.M.C.A. swimming pool. It was really tremendous.

The other day I asked Sandra if she had a picture. Last night she gave me this one. She also drew this “duck in water” for me to take with me.

In a way I feel that I was left in Sterling so long so I could help baptize the Slifers. They are really going to be an asset to the branch.

After I told President Nelson I was leaving he took me aside & told me that he was going to school next spring

Sister Armstrong said the branch has about 100 members. A lot are inactive though. They meet in the American Legion building here in town. They have both a primary & M.I.A. organized. It has been about 10 months since the Elders were here last.

This morning Sister Taualii called & told me to come over for breakfast. I explained that I didn’t have time but she insisted that I come over & get a lunch at least. So she packed a real nice lunch for us. She is the Relief Society President & she has really helped us a lot. They always invited us over to eat. She made two white dresses especially for us while I was there & she fixed my suits a number of times. If you

We had to get estimates on our car to get it fixed besides getting settled in the apartment. The members are real good to us. We had a big dinner with a family yesterday. Everything is a lot more expensive here.

My companion, Elder Banry is from Oregon. He is really a good missionary. We have a lot of referrals from the members.

It’s now Tuesday evening. On the way back from Chicago we stopped at one of the members & he referred us to a good friend. We taught them & they are real interested now.

Well we have met some real nice people in Ottawa but once we meet them it seems like we have a hard time teaching them. We have some good meetings set up later this week though.

Yesterday about 5PM we drove to Joliet where we met the Elders there & rode into Chicago with them. Richard L Evans was the speaker in a special Sacrament meeting. All the Elders in the region were there. It was a very good meeting. Two young & recent converts gave talks besides Apostle Evans. Then this morning our District played another Chicago District in basketball. We had a real good workout for a change. It sure was a long drive there & back.

We have sure spent a lot of money here in Ottawa. We are both about broke now. There are three Elders that owe my companion money & I have about $20 coming from the Elder in Sterling. Yesterday we bought $3 worth of gas - most of it was pennies.

This isn’t a hint for more money...it’s just that we don’t have it all here. I should be able to get by on $100 next month.

My companion and I are getting along real well. He is really a character.

I wrote postcards to a few of the people we were meeting with in Sterling. Also I wrote the Slifers & told them how I enjoyed working with them. Thanks for all the letters you write to the people out here Mom. President & Sister Nelson were really shocked to get a letter from you. It really touched them.

We had Branch conference yesterday & all the Stake Presidency from Chicago was here. It was real good. We had a potluck dinner between sessions.

Well I finally got reimbursed by the Elder in Sterling. I also got your letter with the check today so now I have plenty of money. I hope I can cash your personal check. In other cities we have trouble unless we go where the Elders have a good credit rating. The banks are pretty particular.

I was glad to hear that Moss took the heifers. I didn’t realize the price of cattle was so low. Did I ever mention when I was in Sterling one of the members fixed us a real choice steak dinner? It was so tender that it just fell apart in your mouth.

The members here are sure good to us. We have eaten out every Sunday & have an appointment for next week.

They have given us a lot of referrals too. This is the first city in which the members have had a lot  their friends to refer us to. Ottawa is about 20,000 population. We cover Streator which is 15 miles south (about 16,000) plus lot of towns to the north & all around. We really do a lot of traveling. Last week we spent $6.00 for gas & we got it for 19.9 cents a gallon.

The members bake a lot of bread & sweets & take it to one of the super markets & have their own special bake sale. They made $160 last Saturday.

We have trouble meeting with our contacts. We have had a lot cancel for various reasons. Tonight we have a very special meeting set up with a lady we met at the phone company (the Engles).

Thanks for the Valentine & money & Doug’s picture. He sure is changing. He looks like a real gentleman doesn’t he? We had a real nice conference in Chicago. This was the first I had gotten to talk with President Nadle alone. He is really a great man. I got to see Elder Litaty & some of the other Elders I have known. I hardly knew any of the Elders there though. The last couple of days everything has been going real great. We hurried home from Chicago & had a meeting with a man we are going to baptize Saturday. It was just last Saturday that he said he wanted to be baptized. After that we had a real good meeting with the 2nd Counselor’s boss. We hope to baptize him next month. Had a cold but it’s about gone. All is well.

We are going to Chicago to play ball this morning. Elder Banry got transferred. My new companion is Gary Gunnell from Idaho. He is a lot of fun to work with. We got permission to baptize a 14 year old boy last week, so all we have to do is teach him now.

I had to wait in the apartment all day for Elder Gunnell to arrive Thursday. So I got to listen to a lot of my tapes again.

I bought me a hair brush the other day.

Today Elder Gunnell was transferred & I recieved Elder Toone as a companion. He has been out about 2 months. I got me a $49 Benrus watch. It is self-winding & normally sells for $71. It is really a good-looking watch & I really like it.

Did I tell you we had a baptism Saturday? We baptized a 14 year old boy & we had his mother come to the services. It was real nice. We had some other non-member parents of member kids come to church Sunday.

Everything is going fine

We are sure having beautiful weather here. We have had a couple more good rains the past week but it always clears off & is good weather during the day. Today is by far the warmest it’s been so far.

Saturday it was nice weather so we got a group of kids together at one of the members homes in Marseilles & played baseball. We had a good time but I am still so stiff I can hardly walk.

Yesterday we went to Chicago for Stake Conference. It was a good conference but it seemed like something was lacking. I guess it’s just that I didn’t know anyone there except those from Ottawa.

It seems like we aren’t having any success with our contacts. Either they are too busy to meet with or else they reject us after the 1st discussion. Elder Litater said he was having the same trouble at conference the other day.

My companion got a letter from the head coach at Dixie. I guess he is going to play football there with a full scholarship.

We stopped at Sister Armstrongs to give her some Book of Mormons & she gave us a loaf of whole wheat bread right out of the oven. It sure tasted good.

It’s funny - we always like to get homemade bread out here - it used to be a treat to get bread from the store.

Well I better close.

Love Gaylon

Dear Mom & Dad

I got your letter last night when we got home from the conference. It was good to hear that you keep getting a little rain. It rained the biggest share of last week here.

I wonder how long it will be before they put that new highway in out by the farm. It sure is taking them a long time. Here in Illinois a lot of the super highway is getting rough & about half worn out & they won’t even have it completed until the end of this year.

I sure didn’t think Mr Reese would be the new Bishop. I think he will be a good one though. I’ll have to write them a letter.

Our conference was really good. Sunday we had a member that is a top psychologist talk to us. We all found that there is a lot about ourselves that we don’t know. He was talking directly to me all night.

Later in the evening we had Crawford Gates (head of music at BYU) put on the fireside & he played some from the Hill Cummorah pagent. I promised myself that I am going to see that someday if it is at all possible.

Yesterday we were in conference straight from 8am to 5pm with just a 10 minute break in between. Then we had a big dinner & had another

short session after that. We were exceptionally tired of sitting as you can well imagine. I was a little disappointed in that I didn’t get a chance to talk to President Nadle. He was so busy that he had to miss some of us.

I borrowed a razor blade & used my adjustable razor this morning. My other razor is so dull that I never felt shaved even right after I had finished. I wrote the company but it would cost over $13 for new blades for it.

Well I better close. I hope you can fill the apartment & keep them rented.

Love always Gaylon

PS
Yes I got the checks you sent.

Dear Mom & Dad

Yesterday was one of the nicest days I have ever seen. The weather was just perfect. We drove about 20 miles north to some members for dinner & it seemed like the first time I had ever been there. Everything was green & all the trees & grass 4-6” high. They have had more rain this spring than they have had for quite a few years.

Last week we taught 7 different families for the first time. We only got return appointments on two of them though. One lady got up & left during the discussion & wouldn’t come back. Another man asked us to leave after

we had finished telling him about the apostasy. That was the first anyone ever walked out, or asked us to leave & it happened twice this week. It sure made us feel bad.

Well we finally got our shopping done. I had to defrost the refrigerator before we could put anything in the ice box. It really builds up fast.

We have a lot of little black ants that are getting in the apartment. They have been getting into the food somewhat. I sure hate to see the bugs come this spring.

What’s the address of Bishop Reese? I haven’t

written to them but I guess I should. I’m getting so I hate to write more all the time. Sometimes I think after I get off my mission I’ll never write another letter but I guess I will.

Well, I’ll close for now

Hi Mom & Dad

I got your letters this morning. It sounds like Laraine & Darwin are planning on building them a house. They must be doing pretty well if they can have a new one built for them. What is he studying in school anyway?

I know Dad has said he was going to sell the farm for a long time, is there a very good chance that he can get what it’s worth out of it? I really don’t know what I want to do. This is something that is starting to worry me now that I realize that in a matter of months I’ll be home again. I am planning on attending the “Y” this fall. I

sure don’t know what I’ll major in though. I haven’t heard from the “Y” for quite a while. The last thing I got from them was a notice that I was admitted back there this fall.

Yesterday it rained off & on then it rained real hard all night last night & finally it quit about noon. I’ve never seen so much rain in my life. The thunder & lightning woke me up several times last night.

About a month ago I gave President Armstrong $20 for the building fund. I had it put in your name Dad so you can deduct it from your

income tax. The members have sure given us a lot of food. Sister Armstrong has given us about 8 quarts of tomatoes & some tomato juice that she bottled last year. It sure is good to get some fresh fruit like that. They have given us all the potatoes we have needed up until now too so I figure we’ve saved at least this much in food.

That’s not to mention the Sunday dinners we get. There has only been one week that we haven’t eaten with some of the members.

Did you notice in the Northern States News last month where Brother Slifer had a short letter in it? It really thrilled

me to see that. I got Easter cards from some of the people we baptized in Sterling. Did I mention the other day I called Sister Legal in Sterling & talked to her. She was going into the hospital so I wanted to talk to her. It really thrilled her to think that I would call. She said the Slifer family had given talks in church & everything.

Well I better close for now. I should write Marilyn & it’s getting late.

I got your letter this morning. It kinda surprised me to hear that you bought a new Dodge. I bet it will really be nice for you to sport around in won’t it dad - I’m glad that I’m not using all your money so you can enjoy a few of the nicer things.

How has the apartment been doing? I hope you have been able to keep it rented.

a|Dear Mom,

I got your letter this morning saying that BYU wants the money by the 15th. This doesn’t give much time when the mail is so slow getting here. Especially when my transfer delayed it. Yes I am planning on getting right into school when I get back. I haven’t talked to President Nadle about getting an early release but I will talk to him Monday more than likely. We have a conference then. I’m sure it will be all right with him if I come home in time for school.

Go ahead & sign the agreement & pay them for the first semester.

We got an apartment for $40 a month so this will help with my expenses. I will use the $25 check Marilyn sent me so you can send that much less to me next month.

Love
Gaylon

Hi Mom & Dad

We are sure having some beautiful weather here. It has been up to 70 degrees once or twice. It has been real warm ever since I got here except for a few days now & then. Everyone is running around with light jackets & all we wear is our suit coats.

I had all my suits cleaned & my overcoat cleaned & water repellant put on it. It sure is expensive to get things cleaned.

Our car brakes went out on us the other day. They leaked fluid out of one of the wheels so we had to send to Chicago to get permission to fix them.

they told us that we have to get the front wheels packed to.

Yesterday we were the speakers at Sacrament meeting. There were a couple of High Council men from the Stake there & so I really felt out of place talking with such good speakers as that behind me.

We had one of our contacts to church for the first time yesterday. It sure seemed good.

We are having a regional conference in Chicago next week at this time. Everyone has been assigned to talk. I sure don’t like to talk, especially in front of all the Elders like that.

Yesterday we ate dinner with some members that live 20 miles north of here. They drive twice each Sunday to church & back. They have a daughter that is going to the “Y” this fall.

I finally sent my application in for housing. They sure got the blank back in a hurry. Do you remember what my grade point average was? I couldn’t remember for sure what it was.

Well I better close this for now.

a|I don’t know for sure when I will be released. I will really have to hurry in order to get to school though I’m sure.

I still don’t know what I want to go out in at school. I have been thinking a lot about it lately & it’s starting to worry me a little. I know I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t know where I want to go.

Dear Mom & Dad

Just a note to include with this check. I’m trying to get it off on time this month.

The weather is just beautiful - everything is green - I’ve worked in flower beds & garden the last few evenings. My rototiller broke so I got it fixed & went to redo a section last night & it froze up like it broke a piston or something. I can’t believe it.

Cami & I harvested the last of my carrots yesterday - they were starting to bolt up & go to seed so I decided I better gather them - the lilacs are sure fragrant & beautiful.

Marilyn & I went with some friends on a boat ride at Lake Pardee & I was able to show them the hills where I work & fire lines we have cut. It was fun to ride up the river & see where all the boats go to fish. I see them daily speeding up the lake so it was fun to see where they go. It was beautiful up in the narrows.
