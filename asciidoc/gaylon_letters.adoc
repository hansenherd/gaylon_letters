== Prologue
Years ago, during a visit to Grandma & Grandpa Hansen's in Richfield, Grandma pulled me aside
and told me she had this box of letters that dad had written to her during his mission, and she wanted me to have
them. It turns out there were several letters written during his first year of college, prior to his mission. I've
had these letters for a long time and at one point had sorted them chronologically as best I could. As part of a
young women's project, I got Jessica to help me transcribe the letters and get them into a form that can be shared
with everyone.

Hi Mom & Dad

Well we got to Provo all right. We arrived here at about 12:30 & then we stopped at the "State Bank of Provo" and took out a checking account. We didn't get the regular account because if we didn't write very many checks it would cost us more than 10 cents a check for a minimum service charge.

When we were checking in I got a wrong key so I have had to get the head resident to open the room every time I go in.

Just after I got checked in, my room-mate came in. His name is Joe Lone & he is from California. He seems to

be a real nice kid. I think we'll get along all right. He is on scholarship to play football. The position he plays is quarter-back so he really isn't so big, about 185#. His dad owns a chemical plant down in California & he's got a 59 Corvette. He took me for a ride downtown to pick up some things that he had forgotten.

Tuesday we got up at 6:30 & took our time getting to breakfast (as everyone did) & so there was a line for about a block waiting to eat. When we went to our first meeting in the Field house were late & it was half full of freshmen, about 4,000.

We got out of taking all those placement tests but they had other meetings for us to attend.

Tuesday night we started out to go to M.I.A. but we couldn't find the right wards until it was kind of late so we just looked in on two or three wards.

Today we had more meetings in the morning & in the afternoon we had 15 minutes with our advisor. He told me that if I didn't declare a major in engineering & just filled some general requirements that it would more than likely take me an extra year. I don't know what to do about that.

Dahl & robert & myself are trying to figure out our registration & we’re all going out in engineering (at least trying to work something out in that field). they recommend 15-15 ½ hours credit & we will most likely have to take 16 ½ hrs. I still can’t decide whether to declare a major or not.

The meals they serve are real good & I quite like my room. It is the most modern rooms available. The only thing I don’t like is the public showers & washing basins.

I think I’ll really like it up here if I can get settled on home classes that I like. We’re going to eat now so I’ve got to get going

-Love, Gaylon

Monday Sept. 25/1961

Hi! Mom & dad. I was going to write you last Saturday & for sure Sunday but somehow the time just flew & I didn’t get around to doing it.

How are you getting along with the haying operation? Did the rain spoil any of it? Or didn’t it rain much after I left. All last Thursday & Friday it rained a steady shower up here. We were sure glad to see the sun come up the other day. It’s been so cloudy & dripping wet for a couple of days that we were beginning to wonder if it would ever clear up. There was a lot of

snow Friday up on Mt. Timpanogos & the surrounding mountains. It has been right cold at nights & early morning.

Boy, this college life sure is expensive. The first time I went to my civil engineering class they gave us a list of all the tools & materials that we would need. Before I got through, it cost thirty dollars. I also had to buy a few notebooks & chemistry lab workbooks.

I went to my religion class Thursday (Robert Tobley & myself)  but the teacher didn’t come. There were only about seven in the class so we got checking our registration late that

afternoon. We found that when we registered in the religion section the advisors had changed the section number on our own cards but they forgot to connect the teacher & room assignments. I don’t know how this will work out but I guess the worst that can happen is that we’ll get behind an extra assignment.

Saturday my roommate (Joe) traded rooms with another guy across the hall. So now my roommate is Bob Wenlen. He’s from Ouray, Colorado. He is sort of quiet but he is real nice. He has a record player & a whole drawer

full of long-playing records. He seems to be real studious & he’s majoring in psychology.

Last Sunday we rode up Provo canyon and was going to take some pictures but it was a little cloudy. We stopped and looked at Bridal Veil falls for a while. They have got three cables going from the highway to the top of the mountain.

How’s the apartment coming along. Are you going to sell it then? Or what?

Dahl just came over for a while & he helped me solve some of my math problems. OH, & Stanley Nielson came in for a few minutes on his way back to S.L.C.

Boy these classes are going to be rough. We had to do a 500-word theme for last Monday in English. Today we had a spelling test & an assignment to read & have a test on Wednesday. Next Friday we have an in class theme. We’ve been hitting math hard everyday & now he’s talking about having a class one night a week to kind of review & explain anything that we don’t have time for in class.

Last Sunday Bob & Dahl bought us a bucket of apples (delicious; $3.00). They were $3.50 but they said we could have them for $3.00 because we

were students at the Y. At the rate we’ve been eating them they’ll be gone in a week. They sure taste good.

We went & seen a real good show the other night out at the pioneer Drive-in. The name of it was “Tamy tell me true” or something like that.

Dahl & Bob (Robert Tobley) said they might be coming down next weekend, but I don’t think I better. Bob, I think, kind of misses that girl of his (Mary Ann).

Well it’s getting kind of late so I better be getting to bed. Write soon.

Love you all

Hi mom & dad

I got your letter yesterday along with one from Laraine. I sure was glad to get them. We just got back from eating so I decided to write while I didn’t have many lessons. Bob & I studied about all day Saturday catching up on them. Then we went to the show “David & Golith”. It was really good. (I doubt that name is spelled right but maybe you can get the meaning).

Friday I went down to the health center & had my physical examination. It took me about an hour so I missed a chemistry class. I had to fill out a long question-air about everything from bad eyes to high blood pressure.

Today we got up & was all dressed up when we remembered that it was conference today. So we just laid around, read, and listened to Bob’s record player. He got a couple of new records in the mail yesterday & he had to break them in.

This afternoon I took him up Provo Canyon so he could take some pictures. He has a Brownie 8 mm. camera, a real nice one. We stayed at ”Bridal Veil falls” & both took pictures of that. There were a lot of people there looking at the falls & Cleggs building. There’s a sign that says that it will be opened on the 15th but I don’t see how they can do it. There is an awful lot of work to be

done, in fact I couldn’t see that they had one much since the last time I was up there.

Saturday I took Bob down to the selective service to sign up but they were closed. I guess I’ll have to take him down some time during the week. He put a dollars worth of gas in the can & it just about filled it. That is after we went up Provo Canyon & out to the lake for awhile. So you can see that I am not using the car very much. There is about three days a week that I don’t even start the motor.

Thanks for sending up the paper articles. I had already heard about Art Nielson going to the hospital after that football game. Robert Tobley had talked to Dean Lansen (the new basketball coach down there) I guess they came up to see the football game when we played San Jose State.

The B.Y.U. football team played North Texas State, or somebody from Texas, last night. When we were going to the show the score was 24-15 in our favor. But during the show they flashed the score on the screen. It was 41-33 in favor of Texas. The whole audience gave a big moan. That was the final score.

NOTE: The BYU vs North Texas State was played on Sept. 30, 1961 with BYU losing 30-41

Yesterday Bob & I washed some sox & a couple of pairs of pants. He ironed his pants so I did too. It wasn’t too bad but I got one seam (or crease) a little off to the one side. You know those green (light) pants that i wore a lot last summer. We was goofen around & I split them all down one side. Maybe you can sew them up when I bring them down but I don’t think I’ll be able to wear them to school any more.

Well I guess I had better close for now. I think we might make it to church

a|Hi mom & Dad,

Well it’s monday so I’ll write. We had a study class this morning with 4 other missionaries this morning, then we all came to our apartment for dinner.

My companions name is Charles Clark & he is from Salt Lake. I am in Evanston, Illinos now. We cover 4-5 other towns around in this area we are just north of Chicago, in fact, the northern tip is in our area.

I got letters from Marilyn & her mom today. She is really busy I guess.

I really like it here. I haven’t noticed any change in the climate yet, I live just a few blocks from the lake. When we were in the mission home the lake was just a few feet from the back door. It looks just like the ocean to me.

Last Thursday, after we had stayed in the mission home one night, they had missionaries come in & go tracting with us. I was really  nervous (I still am as for as that goes)

a|But we got in & gave part of a lesson in 4 homes. My companion said that was pretty good. I am having trouble learning the lessons. Also I’m having problems remembering the names of all the people I should.

Last night my companion & I showed the film “What is a Mormon” to 11 of the youth in the First Baptist Church & the Reverend. It was quite funny, they asked us to come for dinner & while it was being prepared the Reverend showed us all through their church. We answered question for about 30 minutes after the film.

I spoke to a baptism Saturday afternoon. I only talked for about two minutes but it scared me anyway. There were eleven from all the areas baptized. Elder Clark said there would probably be 50-60 baptized in the whole N.S. mission.

I’ve got to help a couple of missionaries move in into another word so I’ll have to close soon.

a|I’m not even considered to be in the mission field. We have a million dollar Stake house in our area where two wards attend church. It’s supposed to be one of the best places in the mission though, even if it is expensive. If they spend only $110.00 they feel real good about it. I’ll let you know when I need some money.

Well I've got to close,

Love you very much

Hi Mom & Dad & Doug

We’re on the way to church so I’ll try & write a little we’re supposed to meet a contact there. He called up Thursday & said he was interested in our church. Also a man called the mission home & said he wanted to be baptized. I couldn’t believe it.

I gave the whole lesson (1st one) for the first time last night. I got going & my mind went blank. I left some of it out Elder Clark said I did pretty good though. I didn’t get near as nervous as I have done when we are just studying & practicing. I know I had a lot of help in controlling my nervousness.

1pm: After church we talked with a lady missionary from northern California. She is giving us some suggestions on how to get more cooperation from the stake missionaries. This mission is really growing in the last while, baptisms have doubled

We are going to speed up the progress & in a few months we’re going to be the top mission in the mid-American missions. They are having competition on a mission & region basis.

7 more were baptized in our region yesterday.

Elder Clark & I are meeting a lot of people and we hope to lead some of them into the water this month. I say lead but actually it seems like pushing. The missionaries put a lot more pressure on people than I even thought they should but now I can see the need for it.

We had a visit with a Mrs. Chamberlain & tried to get her to let us teach her or come to church but she wouldn’t. She is the only parent & has 4 kids. Some of the girls have been attending MIA & really like it so she decided rather than take a chance of them joining

she is taking her whole family to her church. She is really a wonderful woman but she is just afraid to change. She is very poor but she is very strong willed so it doesn't look like we have a chance to teach her. How would you approach someone like that? I certainly don't know.

Everything is really great here. The time is really flying. We have a cleaner that does our shirts for us free so that really makes it nice.

Well I’ve got to close so write soon

Your loving son

Dear Mr & Mrs. Hansen & Doug,

I guess it is about time I stop being so slothful and get a letter off to a family I love very much.

I just received the tape from Gaylon of his farewell. When I played it- it was like reliving it all over again. I think it was real good for me to hear it.

Gaylon sure has grown in the past 14 months hasn’t he? I am so glad that he loves the work so. The people seem to also have a love for the Elders.

How have all of you been? I bet it is getting real cold down there. Boy, it sure is here.

My work is coming along fine. We have a really fun

office and bunch of girls. It really is different than being around L.D.S. girls though.

There really isn’t much news around here. My family is fine. Mom and I both feel fine. My bottom still bothers me but in general I feel a lot better. I am sure thankful for that.

How is Doug doing in his school work. How are Connie & Laraine’s families?

I am going to close for now. I sure do miss being close to your family. I sure will be glad when these next ten months are over and Gaylon and I can be together again. My love for Gaylon has grown more and more since he has been gone.

Dear Mr. & Mrs. Hansen & Doug,

The first thing I want to say is that I love all so much. Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness in sending me lovely and so much appreciated gifts. You are so clever. I wish I could thank you in another way than by words. You all have done so much for me and I surely appreciate it.

We had a very lovely christmas. Our family has so much fun when we’re all together. Most of my gifts were for my hope chest.

I have found out that I need glasses. I wonder what else can happen. My other problem still isn’t cleared up. I have to see the Dr. Thursday, the bleeding still hasn’t stopped.

How was your Christmas? Were you all able to get together? Next year Gaylon will be home. That sure will be nice. I love the work he is doing, but I’ll sure be glad when he gets back.

We got here at Provo about 5:30 pm. Connie and I sure had a mice visit on the way down and back. I’m sure glad we can be as close as we are.

Hi Mom & Dad,

I guess I won’t get time to write a letter so I’ll send this.

We had two softball games in Davenport Iowa last week. Our girls beat 19-11 & our boys got beat 9-15. We have a lot of kids playing on our teams. We have a lot of fun taking them to play ball. A couple of them should be baptized before long.

We are taking everyone to a Hawaiian barbecue this Sat. It should be good fellowship for them. Sister Brill -- the lady we baptized, is a completely different person almost. I can’t believe how much she has changed. It’s amazing what the gospel can do for these people when they accept it. Things are going great.

Love Gaylon

Hi Mom & Dad

We are on our way to Cedar Rabids to District Conference this morning. We got up at 4:30 so we could make it there in time for priesthood meeting but it looks like we won’t make it. We picked up the Elders in Rock Island & we had to wait a while for them. We are on a big super-highway with a 75 M.P.H. speed limit.

The corn is really something to see here in Iowa. The tassels are brown & now the foliage is

drying up & turning brown too. They plant all over the rolling hills & you can see corn for miles & miles. Everyplace there is a drainage area or where two hills form a small valley the corn hasn’t grown because of too much water.

This month the mission is dedicating to Pres. McKay since he will be 90. I guess it is his birthday today isn’t it? The work is going real well. We have three families that could be baptized this month if we can help them overcome their

problems. The lady whose husband died (Sis. Legal) said she would start coming to church. She doesn’t want to join because it would be hard for her to be baptized & also she doesn’t think she can pay tithing. They are really having a hard time. The one 11 year old boy can’t sleep at home because he things about seeing his father laying on the floor. He was the first one to find but his father was dead.

We finally made it but we can’t find the school. Everything is going ok.

Well Mom & Dad we are now traveling to Davenport or our missionary conference. It was really great this morn & afternoon.

Bro & Sis Clancy came to the conference. She was having trouble with her back & wasn’t going to come but when Bro Clancy found out that I was there he went & got her. It was kina funny - they wouldn’t let me out of their sight. She can’t be baptized for 6-8 months & she said she wants me to baptize her.
