== Prologue
Years ago, during a visit to Grandma & Grandpa Hansen's in Richfield, Grandma pulled me aside
and told me she had this box of letters that dad had written to her during his mission, and she wanted me to have
them. It turns out there were several letters written during his first year of college, prior to his mission. I've
had these letters for a long time and at one point had sorted them chronologically as best I could. As part of a
young women's project, I got Jessica to help me transcribe the letters and get them into a form that can be shared
with everyone.

Hi Mom & Dad

Well we got to Provo all right. We arrived here at about 12:30 & then we stopped at the "State Bank of Provo" and took out a checking account. We didn't get the regular account because if we didn't write very many checks it would cost us more than 10 cents a check for a minimum service charge.

When we were checking in I got a wrong key so I have had to get the head resident to open the room every time I go in.

Just after I got checked in, my room-mate came in. His name is Joe Lone & he is from California. He seems to

be a real nice kid. I think we'll get along all right. He is on scholarship to play football. The position he plays is quarter-back so he really isn't so big, about 185#. His dad owns a chemical plant down in California & he's got a 59 Corvette. He took me for a ride downtown to pick up some things that he had forgotten.

Tuesday we got up at 6:30 & took our time getting to breakfast (as everyone did) & so there was a line for about a block waiting to eat. When we went to our first meeting in the Field house were late & it was half full of freshmen, about 4,000.

We got out of taking all those placement tests but they had other meetings for us to attend.

Tuesday night we started out to go to M.I.A. but we couldn't find the right wards until it was kind of late so we just looked in on two or three wards.

Today we had more meetings in the morning & in the afternoon we had 15 minutes with our advisor. He told me that if I didn't declare a major in engineering & just filled some general requirements that it would more than likely take me an extra year. I don't know what to do about that.

Dahl & robert & myself are trying to figure out our registration & we’re all going out in engineering (at least trying to work something out in that field). they recommend 15-15 ½ hours credit & we will most likely have to take 16 ½ hrs. I still can’t decide whether to declare a major or not.

The meals they serve are real good & I quite like my room. It is the most modern rooms available. The only thing I don’t like is the public showers & washing basins.

I think I’ll really like it up here if I can get settled on home classes that I like. We’re going to eat now so I’ve got to get going

-Love, Gaylon

Monday Sept. 25/1961

Hi! Mom & dad. I was going to write you last Saturday & for sure Sunday but somehow the time just flew & I didn’t get around to doing it.

How are you getting along with the haying operation? Did the rain spoil any of it? Or didn’t it rain much after I left. All last Thursday & Friday it rained a steady shower up here. We were sure glad to see the sun come up the other day. It’s been so cloudy & dripping wet for a couple of days that we were beginning to wonder if it would ever clear up. There was a lot of

snow Friday up on Mt. Timpanogos & the surrounding mountains. It has been right cold at nights & early morning.

Boy, this college life sure is expensive. The first time I went to my civil engineering class they gave us a list of all the tools & materials that we would need. Before I got through, it cost thirty dollars. I also had to buy a few notebooks & chemistry lab workbooks.

I went to my religion class Thursday (Robert Tobley & myself)  but the teacher didn’t come. There were only about seven in the class so we got checking our registration late that

afternoon. We found that when we registered in the religion section the advisors had changed the section number on our own cards but they forgot to connect the teacher & room assignments. I don’t know how this will work out but I guess the worst that can happen is that we’ll get behind an extra assignment.

Saturday my roommate (Joe) traded rooms with another guy across the hall. So now my roommate is Bob Wenlen. He’s from Ouray, Colorado. He is sort of quiet but he is real nice. He has a record player & a whole drawer

full of long-playing records. He seems to be real studious & he’s majoring in psychology.

Last Sunday we rode up Provo canyon and was going to take some pictures but it was a little cloudy. We stopped and looked at Bridal Veil falls for a while. They have got three cables going from the highway to the top of the mountain.

How’s the apartment coming along. Are you going to sell it then? Or what?

Dahl just came over for a while & he helped me solve some of my math problems. OH, & Stanley Nielson came in for a few minutes on his way back to S.L.C.

Boy these classes are going to be rough. We had to do a 500-word theme for last Monday in English. Today we had a spelling test & an assignment to read & have a test on Wednesday. Next Friday we have an in class theme. We’ve been hitting math hard everyday & now he’s talking about having a class one night a week to kind of review & explain anything that we don’t have time for in class.

Last Sunday Bob & Dahl bought us a bucket of apples (delicious; $3.00). They were $3.50 but they said we could have them for $3.00 because we

were students at the Y. At the rate we’ve been eating them they’ll be gone in a week. They sure taste good.

We went & seen a real good show the other night out at the pioneer Drive-in. The name of it was “Tamy tell me true” or something like that.

Dahl & Bob (Robert Tobley) said they might be coming down next weekend, but I don’t think I better. Bob, I think, kind of misses that girl of his (Mary Ann).

Well it’s getting kind of late so I better be getting to bed. Write soon.

Love you all

Hi mom & dad

I got your letter yesterday along with one from Laraine. I sure was glad to get them. We just got back from eating so I decided to write while I didn’t have many lessons. Bob & I studied about all day Saturday catching up on them. Then we went to the show “David & Golith”. It was really good. (I doubt that name is spelled right but maybe you can get the meaning).

Friday I went down to the health center & had my physical examination. It took me about an hour so I missed a chemistry class. I had to fill out a long question-air about everything from bad eyes to high blood pressure.

Today we got up & was all dressed up when we remembered that it was conference today. So we just laid around, read, and listened to Bob’s record player. He got a couple of new records in the mail yesterday & he had to break them in.

This afternoon I took him up Provo Canyon so he could take some pictures. He has a Brownie 8 mm. camera, a real nice one. We stayed at ”Bridal Veil falls” & both took pictures of that. There were a lot of people there looking at the falls & Cleggs building. There’s a sign that says that it will be opened on the 15th but I don’t see how they can do it. There is an awful lot of work to be

done, in fact I couldn’t see that they had one much since the last time I was up there.

Saturday I took Bob down to the selective service to sign up but they were closed. I guess I’ll have to take him down some time during the week. He put a dollars worth of gas in the can & it just about filled it. That is after we went up Provo Canyon & out to the lake for awhile. So you can see that I am not using the car very much. There is about three days a week that I don’t even start the motor.

Thanks for sending up the paper articles. I had already heard about Art Nielson going to the hospital after that football game. Robert Tobley had talked to Dean Lansen (the new basketball coach down there) I guess they came up to see the football game when we played San Jose State.

The B.Y.U. football team played North Texas State, or somebody from Texas, last night. When we were going to the show the score was 24-15 in our favor. But during the show they flashed the score on the screen. It was 41-33 in favor of Texas. The whole audience gave a big moan. That was the final score.

NOTE: The BYU vs North Texas State was played on Sept. 30, 1961 with BYU losing 30-41

Yesterday Bob & I washed some sox & a couple of pairs of pants. He ironed his pants so I did too. It wasn’t too bad but I got one seam (or crease) a little off to the one side. You know those green (light) pants that i wore a lot last summer. We was goofen around & I split them all down one side. Maybe you can sew them up when I bring them down but I don’t think I’ll be able to wear them to school any more.

Well I guess I had better close for now. I think we might make it to church

a|Hi mom & Dad,

Well it’s monday so I’ll write. We had a study class this morning with 4 other missionaries this morning, then we all came to our apartment for dinner.

My companions name is Charles Clark & he is from Salt Lake. I am in Evanston, Illinos now. We cover 4-5 other towns around in this area we are just north of Chicago, in fact, the northern tip is in our area.

I got letters from Marilyn & her mom today. She is really busy I guess.

I really like it here. I haven’t noticed any change in the climate yet, I live just a few blocks from the lake. When we were in the mission home the lake was just a few feet from the back door. It looks just like the ocean to me.

Last Thursday, after we had stayed in the mission home one night, they had missionaries come in & go tracting with us. I was really  nervous (I still am as for as that goes)

a|But we got in & gave part of a lesson in 4 homes. My companion said that was pretty good. I am having trouble learning the lessons. Also I’m having problems remembering the names of all the people I should.

Last night my companion & I showed the film “What is a Mormon” to 11 of the youth in the First Baptist Church & the Reverend. It was quite funny, they asked us to come for dinner & while it was being prepared the Reverend showed us all through their church. We answered question for about 30 minutes after the film.

I spoke to a baptism Saturday afternoon. I only talked for about two minutes but it scared me anyway. There were eleven from all the areas baptized. Elder Clark said there would probably be 50-60 baptized in the whole N.S. mission.

I’ve got to help a couple of missionaries move in into another word so I’ll have to close soon.

a|I’m not even considered to be in the mission field. We have a million dollar Stake house in our area where two wards attend church. It’s supposed to be one of the best places in the mission though, even if it is expensive. If they spend only $110.00 they feel real good about it. I’ll let you know when I need some money.

Well I've got to close,

Love you very much

Hi Mom & Dad & Doug

We’re on the way to church so I’ll try & write a little we’re supposed to meet a contact there. He called up Thursday & said he was interested in our church. Also a man called the mission home & said he wanted to be baptized. I couldn’t believe it.

I gave the whole lesson (1st one) for the first time last night. I got going & my mind went blank. I left some of it out Elder Clark said I did pretty good though. I didn’t get near as nervous as I have done when we are just studying & practicing. I know I had a lot of help in controlling my nervousness.

1pm: After church we talked with a lady missionary from northern California. She is giving us some suggestions on how to get more cooperation from the stake missionaries. This mission is really growing in the last while, baptisms have doubled

We are going to speed up the progress & in a few months we’re going to be the top mission in the mid-American missions. They are having competition on a mission & region basis.

7 more were baptized in our region yesterday.

Elder Clark & I are meeting a lot of people and we hope to lead some of them into the water this month. I say lead but actually it seems like pushing. The missionaries put a lot more pressure on people than I even thought they should but now I can see the need for it.

We had a visit with a Mrs. Chamberlain & tried to get her to let us teach her or come to church but she wouldn’t. She is the only parent & has 4 kids. Some of the girls have been attending MIA & really like it so she decided rather than take a chance of them joining

she is taking her whole family to her church. She is really a wonderful woman but she is just afraid to change. She is very poor but she is very strong willed so it doesn't look like we have a chance to teach her. How would you approach someone like that? I certainly don't know.

Everything is really great here. The time is really flying. We have a cleaner that does our shirts for us free so that really makes it nice.

Well I’ve got to close so write soon

Your loving son

Dear Mr & Mrs. Hansen & Doug,

I guess it is about time I stop being so slothful and get a letter off to a family I love very much.

I just received the tape from Gaylon of his farewell. When I played it- it was like reliving it all over again. I think it was real good for me to hear it.

Gaylon sure has grown in the past 14 months hasn’t he? I am so glad that he loves the work so. The people seem to also have a love for the Elders.

How have all of you been? I bet it is getting real cold down there. Boy, it sure is here.

My work is coming along fine. We have a really fun

office and bunch of girls. It really is different than being around L.D.S. girls though.

There really isn’t much news around here. My family is fine. Mom and I both feel fine. My bottom still bothers me but in general I feel a lot better. I am sure thankful for that.

How is Doug doing in his school work. How are Connie & Laraine’s families?

I am going to close for now. I sure do miss being close to your family. I sure will be glad when these next ten months are over and Gaylon and I can be together again. My love for Gaylon has grown more and more since he has been gone.

Dear Mr. & Mrs. Hansen & Doug,

The first thing I want to say is that I love all so much. Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness in sending me lovely and so much appreciated gifts. You are so clever. I wish I could thank you in another way than by words. You all have done so much for me and I surely appreciate it.

We had a very lovely christmas. Our family has so much fun when we’re all together. Most of my gifts were for my hope chest.

I have found out that I need glasses. I wonder what else can happen. My other problem still isn’t cleared up. I have to see the Dr. Thursday, the bleeding still hasn’t stopped.

How was your Christmas? Were you all able to get together? Next year Gaylon will be home. That sure will be nice. I love the work he is doing, but I’ll sure be glad when he gets back.

We got here at Provo about 5:30 pm. Connie and I sure had a mice visit on the way down and back. I’m sure glad we can be as close as we are.

Hi Mom & Dad,

I guess I won’t get time to write a letter so I’ll send this.

We had two softball games in Davenport Iowa last week. Our girls beat 19-11 & our boys got beat 9-15. We have a lot of kids playing on our teams. We have a lot of fun taking them to play ball. A couple of them should be baptized before long.

We are taking everyone to a Hawaiian barbecue this Sat. It should be good fellowship for them. Sister Brill -- the lady we baptized, is a completely different person almost. I can’t believe how much she has changed. It’s amazing what the gospel can do for these people when they accept it. Things are going great.

Hi Mom & Dad

We are on our way to Cedar Rabids to District Conference this morning. We got up at 4:30 so we could make it there in time for priesthood meeting but it looks like we won’t make it. We picked up the Elders in Rock Island & we had to wait a while for them. We are on a big super-highway with a 75 M.P.H. speed limit.

The corn is really something to see here in Iowa. The tassels are brown & now the foliage is

drying up & turning brown too. They plant all over the rolling hills & you can see corn for miles & miles. Everyplace there is a drainage area or where two hills form a small valley the corn hasn’t grown because of too much water.

This month the mission is dedicating to Pres. McKay since he will be 90. I guess it is his birthday today isn’t it? The work is going real well. We have three families that could be baptized this month if we can help them overcome their

problems. The lady whose husband died (Sis. Legal) said she would start coming to church. She doesn’t want to join because it would be hard for her to be baptized & also she doesn’t think she can pay tithing. They are really having a hard time. The one 11 year old boy can’t sleep at home because he things about seeing his father laying on the floor. He was the first one to find but his father was dead.

We finally made it but we can’t find the school. Everything is going ok.

Bro & Sis Clancy came to the conference. She was having trouble with her back & wasn’t going to come but when Bro Clancy found out that I was there he went & got her. It was kina funny - they wouldn’t let me out of their sight. She can’t be baptized for 6-8 months & she said she wants me to baptize her.

Hi Mom & Dad

Elder Beals got transferred & I am taking him to Galisburg in our car, that’s about 90 miles S.W. I really hate to see him go. I really grew to love him. I have met the Elder that will be working with me. His name is Elder Healy. I think he is real shy & quiet from what I know of him. It will really be a challenge for me.

I am sending home a box of letters that I have collected. I would like to have you put them somewhere where the kids won’t get into them, there are some pamphlets that we use in teaching in with the letters. If you would like to read the pamphlets go ahead & open the package

Hi Mom & Dad

The other day while the kids were in primary we went tracting for about 30 min. & found a young couple that are really interested. It was really quite an experience. Everything is going great. I got some new glass frames. My new suit is dark with a few blue threads in it. I really like it. I think I’ll need about $20 to finish the month - I have about $10 left after all expenses & rent.

We have conference next weekend. I guess I’ll see Stan just before he goes home.

Conference was just terrific. I talked to pres Maycock for the last time. We are dedicating thes month to him & Sis Maycock.

They have a big place of the corn up. If their cilos won't hold it they make a circle out of snow fence & put the rest of the corn in that. Everything's great.

Love Gaylon

I got to baptize Sis. Clancy Sunday after conference. It was really great. They took us to dinner.

Hi Mom & Dad

Elder Curtis & I are doing real well together. The first of last week we couldn't get anything accomplished but later on we had a log of meetings. Elder Curtis gave all he knew of the 1st discussions 6 times.

We decided to buy a copy of "A Marvelous Work And  A Wonder" for some of our contacts for X-Mas. We sent an order to the mission home for over $13 for supplies & some of those books.

I didn't know what to get you for X-Mas so I sent for a couple of books that I have heard are really tremendous. I had them mail them to you in Dad's name so don't open them until X-Mas when they come.

Mom could you order a subscription to Connie & Larraine &

their families for me? If they ever get a chance to read I know they would really enjoy that. I never really realized there was such a good magazine put out by the church until I came out here.

Last month they had a big color picture of all the temples & a big story about each.

One of the members has invited us out to X-mas dinner already. She has a girl in Cedar city going to school. Karen Padgett is her name.

Marily wrote & said she had listened to my farewell tape so I guess it got there all right.

Our traveling Elder said there wouldn't be many transfers from now to X-Mas so I will be here until after the New Year sometime.

I got your check ok. I have plenty of money. I got the

card saying I'd get the Relief Society magazine.

It sounds like you are really working in the Relief Society mom. It sure makes me glad to hear you took charge. I know just what you mean when you say you were scared.

It sounds like you are going to have some good meat for this winter. We usually buy hamburger. The last while we have gotten it for 29 cents a pound. Usually it's 49 cents/#.

I have really been busy trying to get X-mas cards sent out. I have them sent to the people I have met in other towns & it can wait a day or two here. It has been real cold the last while here. It is snowing today. We put a light under our car battery to keep it warm. We had to have a tune up before it would even begin to start.

Hi! Mom, Dad & Doug

Well today is Monday again. I guess this will be the shortest time I will be with one companion. He called Pres Maycock & he made an appointment for him to see a doctor in Champaine Ill. He called him again Thursday & found that he was being transferred there. He will leave Thursday.

We have really been getting along good. It was hard for me the first week but he is coming out of it a lot. He gave a couple of discussions this last couple days - that's something he hadn't done for months previous to this.

We both talked in Sacrament meeting yesterday. He surprised everyone by giving an excellent

talk. It made me feel rather ashamed of myself.

We had a wonderful turnout of investigators. We had 8 out for the first time plus all the ones we have baptized.

Sunday night we had a tremendous fireside at Bro. Nelsons. There were about 20 people there & we had the young boys that we baptized give short talks. Then I played my tape recording of the "Joseph Smith Story". Everyone really liked it. One of the members that is on the District High Council asked me if I could get a recording from mine.

Welder Bealey really hates to leave. We have met a lot of fine youth & he says he has talked more to people here than he ever thought of. I guess he had to being with me.

There is no such thing as a Senior companion here. we each take charge & have the final say every other week.

Hi Mom & Dad

This past week has really been terrific. Brother & Sister Slifer were interviewed today. They will be baptized Sunday. They have really been interested. They were to church for the 2nd time Sunday. When I gave them the 3rd discussion, they gave me 2 pipes 1/2 carton cigarettes & over a pound of coffee. They have accepted everything we have told them. They wanted to go to Chicago on the first to our all mission baptism but he has to work. We have a young man that has been interviewed & should go. We have had a lot of good meetings. Tonight we met with a family that we have been working off & on with for about 4 months. The wife heard about baptism for the dead & she wouldn't even listen. Finally through the husband we have got to listen to our discussions. They were really impressed & invited us back real soon.

Everything is going great.

I came back alone and it seemed different being alone for a few hours. I really hated to see Elder Beals go. I really got along well with him.

Washer with tubs and a ringer like you used to have. They are sure good to us.

I got two cavities filled this morning by President Nelson. He is really a good dentist. I wouldn’t let him freeze my mouth and he said most people wouldn’t let him drill without it. I would a lot rather have him drill and have it hurt a little than have your face numb all day.

My watch is in the repair shop. It will cost about $10.00 to have it cleaned and fixed. I guess the main thing wrong is that it needs cleaning.

I’m sure glad to hear the crops are doing so well. If you can keep the beets doing ok they should do all right for you with the jump in the price of sugar and all.

We had our second practice today and when we told them they had to come to church to play, they got all mad and were going to quit.

Also today I bought a new pair of shoes. They had a big sale on, so I bought a real nice pair.

Hi Mom & Dad

Last Thursday Elder Healey was transferred to Champaign Illinois so now I have a new companion. His name is Elder Christenson and he is one of the Elders I came out with. We are getting along real well. He was supposed to get here Thursday but he didn’t make it until Friday about 2:30pm. I took Elder Healey to the train at 6am Thursday so I was alone for quite a while. It really seemed funny. I had a lot of things I wanted to do though so the time went fast. I still didn’t get time to write to Karl & Dahl. I did send a tape to Connie & Vernon.

Mom that was sure sweet of you to send that note to my landlady. She didn’t or hasn’t said anything yet but I’m sure it made her feel good. I just handed it to her as we were going to a meeting.

Well we finally have an M.I.A. here. They announced Sunday that this Tuesday would be our opening social. We are really looking forward to it.

Friday we were walking out of a family home & met the paperboy and started talking to him. He was interested in the youth program so we made an appointment to meet his parents that evening. We went and talked to them and they are really interested. They stayed and talked to us until they were late for another appointment.

It looks like we are really going to have a lot of success this month. We have at least 8 that should be baptized if all goes well. We have given these over half of the discussions. One family we met a week ago and they have come to church twice, primary and a Sunday School party. At one of the parks. Besides we have taught them 3 discussions, they are really coming along.

Hi Mom and Dad

Yesterday we had a tremendous District Conference in Cedar Rapids. President Maycock and his counselors all spoke along with the district officers. Pres. Maycock really called everyone to repentance. I think everyone left with somewhat of a guilty conscience. He especially called down the members for quarreling and back-biting. Then last night we had a testimony meeting for two hours.

Today we are going to meet at the chapel and then go play softball and volleyball for a few hours and then we will resume the conference. We are staying at one of the members homes near Cedar Rapids. When we came in last night they had a big stack of ham sandwiches and some apple pie for us to snack on. They are really treating us great.

We have been teaching a family that are really big people in Waterloo and they were going to come to conference yesterday but his father got extremely sick and on the verge of death so they couldn’t come. Something like this has happened for the past three weeks to prevent them from coming to church. The old devil really works on the people out here to keep them from joining the church.

I was really glad to hear that Marilyn came and stayed with you before she left. She said she had such a wonderful time and that you treated her so well. It makes me feel good to know that you get along so well.

The Conference was really a call to repentance for everyone yesterday.

Well, I’ve got to close off. Find out what speeds Connie has on her tape recorder. Tell her I am sorry I haven’t written and I’ll try to write her soon. If she has 1 ⅞ speed, I could send her The Book of Mormon. She said she wanted it.

Hi Mom and Dad

Well today is Monday and we are moving to Waterloo today. We have an apartment there for $50 plus utilities and then we will have a little more room and be closer to the work. I am through packing and am waiting for my companion. Our new address will be: 920 ½ Broadway, Waterloo, Iowa. We are right on a main highway there so it will be real convenient that way, but we are also right next to the railroad tracks and trains pass quite frequently.

My companion bought him a $200 stereo tape recorder the other day. It made mine look sick. It is really a fancy one. Mine is giving me a lot of service. Nothing has went wrong with it really. I’ve had to clean it a couple of times and do a little tinkering with it but it works real well. If you can remember ask Connie how long the warranty is for it. I was just wondering because my companion had to take a new recorder back because it didn’t work properly - that’s when he got his big recorder. Also how long was the warranty on my clock good for? I just got it back for the second time and it still doesn’t work like I think it should. I wish I had just threw it away and got another. There has been so much delay and trouble getting it through the mail and them not fixing it and all. Maybe if I

would have sent it in earlier I would have gotten better results though so I guess it’s my own fault.

I am in Waterloo now. I just got through calling the water company and the electrical power company to get that taken care of. It sure is a big nuisance to get all this taken care of. We are having a lot of complications as to whose name it is going to be in. We finally got it in their name so it will save us a $8 deposit.

We have to buy a phone and have it put in so I guess that will cost us another $10.

It has been raining a lot the past couple of days - we really got a good soaking yesterday. How is the water situation back there? I guess it is still bad - isn’t it?

There is a real good family living in the house below us. We have an appointment to show them the film and they seem real interested. We also are working with our landlord who is part owner in a rambler agency here. The work is starting to pick up and I feel real good about it.

I hope everything is going file. Have them send the Era to my new address or the mission home. I am really glad they are sending it. That is the one magazine we read.

with him. He said they had some problems to talk over. So I got a good nights rest while he travelled 20 miles. Also they got picked up for only having one light and to top it off they had a flat tire. I think I got the best of that deal.

I really like it here in Waterloo. It is a nice town but the street setup is really a mess.

We would like to give them some to show our appreciation if you still have a lot, if you don't then never mind. We have a big Conference this weekend. The Stake is being split.

Hi Everyone

Its M-day again & we are waiting for Elder Nielsen & Christensen to get their teeth checked.

It's a lot warner now. We haven't had any trouble getting our car started since we got it fixed. It sure takes a lot of gas in this cold weather. We have had to start Elder Nielsons car with jumper cables & when it is stubborn to start we use a lot of gas just racing the motor.

It seems like I spend a lot more money than I should. I am going to try & cut down on expenses this month. Last month (4-week period) I spent $135.00. Of course I bought $18.00 worth of tape that I would not ordinarily have spent. We used the tape & have finished recording the Book of Mormon Pearl of Great Price & The D.&C.

I'm glad we were able to get it on tape. It will be nice to have

even after I get off my mission.

We are going to have a big conference next Sunday - Tues. - Sunday LeGrand Richards & Howard Hunter are going to be here & divide Chicago Stake & make three stakes. They are going to talk to us in a special missionary conference. Then all day Monday & Tuesday we will be in a Region Conference.

We may go to a mueseum this afternoon.

How is the apartments coming along? I hope you can keep most of them rented.

I finally got my book & this letter from the Bishop. We helped his wife get their car home after she hit a tree. She couldn't stop on slick roads. I left my boots & this letter in the car.

We saw the Museum of Science & Industry, or at lest we spent the afternoon

trying to see parts of it. There is so much that is really fascinating that we couldn't begin to see it.

We took the records B of M D&C & P. of G.P. back to Sister Morgan. She said they cost a total of $100. We got them on tape for less than $15. I still have a couple of reels left over. We got it for $1.88 a of 2400 feet - it is pretty good tape for that price. I am now recording "The Son of God" a talk given by Pres. Edmunds entirely from the scriptures.

I guess I better close & review for our test on the study guide in conference.

Tell everyone hello for me.

I guess I should write the Bishop but I don't know hardly what to say. I hate to write & tell him the whole mission is in a big slump. Especially when there is all the talk about increased baptisms in all the missions.

Write soon

NOTE: Note on back of the envelope

I got your letter today - no I haven't recieved that tape Marilyn was supposed to have spent. My recorder is all right. I cleaned the recording heads & it works a lot better. The Book of Mormon is advertisted in the Improvement Era for 50 dollars. If I find I can't use it very much I could send the tapes to Connie & Vernon. Tell Laraine I was glad to hear from her. It sounds like Greg is doing real well.

Hi Mom & Dad

Well it’s the 11th of March & cold as ever. It was clear all day yesterday but it still didn’t melt at all. There must be an arctic mass of cold air over us.

I am using my tape recorder quite a bit. Last week we got a recording by the British Broadcasting Company entitled “This Is The Place”. It tells the story of the church from Joseph Smith on. It is really funny with the English accent of the speakers. We are going to use it at a fireside this weekend.

I have been thinking about calling you the past few days

Elder Rothey called home Thursday & talked for 20 minutes. It cost him about $11 to. His folks are moving from Ogden to Richmond, Virginia.

We went to a party for the Relief Society Saturday night. The Women & their husbands were there & we played some silly games & then had a big dinner.

The work is really going slow. I guess I should say we are really going slow. We don’t have any investigators at all. We went to a family yesterday & they stood us up for the 4th time in a row.

The traveling Elders stopped for about 25 minutes last

Tuesday. They are thinking about closing down the city & moving us to another.

I sure am discouraged. It’s not because of the work so much as it is just me. Sometimes I think I am losing my memory. When I study or try to remember names or places I can’t get anything to register. They say you can train your brain just like you can develop a muscle & I can sure see that mine is not trained.

We spend a lot of time just trying to think of somewhere

to go & something to do. I get so lazy sometimes that I get to the point that I almost don’t even care.

I guess I shouldn’t be writing you like this. I am just a little depressed at the things I am doing.

At least here there is enough time for me to study that I can keep up in my study guide. That is more than I could do in Evanston.

I bet Connie & them will really get a lot of enjoyment out of the piano. I bet it really makes the house look bare doesn’t it?

Mom you are sending the money plenty early. If it gets here by the first of the month or a few days before that is early enough. Just know I can get it cashed & have it to pay rent on the first. I was wondering if you were getting ahead of me for a month. This last check you sent me should last until the end of April.

It is good to have a little money ahead but the past couple of months I have been packing the checks with me until about the last day of the month & I don’t think

Hi Mom & Dad

It looks like I will soon be transferred. This weekend we are having an “all mission” conference in Carthage Illinois. All the Elders in the mission will be there. This will probably be the only one I’ll get to attend while I’m on my mission because they only have them every 2-3 years.

Since everyone will be there it will be real easy to make transfers. I am thinking I’ll get a letter any day now telling me to bring all my things to the conference but I sure hope not. We have a lot of good people we are teaching & we just met another real good family last night.

We baptized the Legal family last Saturday in Davenport.

Sister Legal weighs about 330 pounds & I thought I might have a tough time but it went real well. We had to have the Relief Society President make a special dress out of some sheets. Her kids Barbara(9) & Gerry(11) were baptized also.

We also baptized a 11 year old girl (Bonnie Cobb). We have had trouble getting to even talk to her mother so we fasted & towards the end of the fast the District Supervisor

I haven’t sent that tape to Marilyn. I was going to talk on it but I haven’t had time.

I got a letter from the Bishopric & they said the beet crop was good this year. I hate to hear dad’s isn’t going too well. He must really be working hard.

I could use some socks for X-mas. I like those I got to come out in or just make sure they are extra long & black. I almost need size 13 if they aren’t stretchy. I could use a couple of ties too. Other than that I am pretty well fixed. I could use a good pen though. Those Laraine gave me finally ran out. I liked them too.

I sounds like Vernon & Connie are really working hard
